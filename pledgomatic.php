<h1>NO2ID Pledges</h1>
<p>NO2ID has teamed up with PledgeBank to allow you to show your feelings about ID cards and take some action.
We have two pledges, depending on whether you are willing to refuse to sign up, or feel that the government
has you over a barrel.  We have labelled these two positions as Resist and Refuse:
</p>
<div style="width:50%; float:left;">
	<h1>Refuse Pledge</h1>
	<blockquote><img name="Phil" src="" width="100" height="100" alt="Phil Booth pic here" style="background-color: #003399;float:left;margin:5px;">I will refuse to register for an ID card and will donate £10 to a legal 
	defence fund but only if 10,000 other people will also make this same pledge.</blockquote>
	<h2><a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/refuse">Sign up to Refuse</a></h2>
	<p>Current Status: 10,800 pledgers (automatically updated?)</p>

</div>
<div style="width:50%; float:left;">
	<h1>Resist Pledge</h1>
	<blockquote><img name="Frankie" src="" width="100" height="100" alt="Frankie pic goes here" style="background-color: #CC3300;float:left;margin:5px;">I will actively support those people who, on behalf of all of us, refuse 
	to register for an ID card, and I pledge to pay at least £20 into a fighting fund for 
	them but only if 50,000 other people will too.</blockquote>

<p>Do we need to give some small print here?  Like - please don't sign both pledges...</p>
