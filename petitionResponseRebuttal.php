<h1>10 Downing Street's delayed response to e-petition</h1>
<p>On 13 January 2005, just over 7 weeks after it was submitted, <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6909.asp">10 
  Downing Street responded to our e-petition</a>. It appears that in attempting 
  to justify its plans, the Government is now even willing to try to redefine 
  the very concept of civil liberties.</p>
<p>Riddled with revisionism, outrageous assertion and pure misinformation, the 
  response insults the intelligence of those who signed and reveals the low regard 
  in which this Government holds its citizens. The following is our paragraph-by-paragraph 
  rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6909.asp"> 
  <p>Proposals for a national compulsory identity cards scheme, to strengthen 
	national security and protect people's identity, were set out on 29 November 
	2004 when the Government published the Identity Cards Bill. Our decision to 
	introduce identity cards has been taken following a wide ranging debate, starting 
	with the announcement in February 2002 of the original consultation and continuing 
	with the consultation on the draft legislation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Government fails to mention the National Identity Register, the 30-odd 
  new powers awarded to the Home Secretary and the punitive fines that form the 
  bulk of the Bill. If these things were genuinely going to protect our identities, 
  then surely the &quot;80%&quot; (ha ha) of us that want them would be queuing 
  up to have them without the 'encouragement' of &pound;1000 and &pound;2500 pound 
  fines?</p>
<p>The debate has been almost non-existent with, for example, no Government or 
  Home Office representative at Mistaken Identity, nor even at some less threatening 
  invitation-only affairs. For people who are so utterly convinced that what they 
  are doing is right, they seem remarkably reluctant to defend, or even make, 
  their case in public.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6909.asp"> 
  <p>The decision to proceed is based in part on the fact that we will have to 
	introduce more secure personal identifiers (biometrics) into our passports 
	and other existing documents in line with international requirements. If our 
	citizens are to continue to enjoy the benefits of international travel, as 
	increasing numbers of them are doing, we cannot be left behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is completely disingenuous. Adding biometric identifiers to passports 
  need involve nothing more expensive or intrusive than putting a digital photo 
  onto a chip - the UK are the only country taking this as an excuse to compulsorily 
  register all its citizens and put them on a massively intrusive privacy-busting 
  database. Are they saying that without ID cards, UK citizens will no longer 
  be able to travel abroad?</p>
<p>If so, they are lying.</p>
<p>The international standards for machine-readable travel documents may require 
  fingerprints in addition to a digitised facial image, but it is our Government 
  and our Government alone who have decided to scan everyone's eyes as well and 
  put all this - and lots more - information into a central database. The reason 
  why the Home Office seperated the ID card from the passport is that they had 
  overloaded the specification so heavily that our passports may no longer have 
  been compliant with international standards.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6909.asp"> 
  <p>Identity cards will provide every person in this country with an easy and 
	secure way of proving their identity, of demonstrating their right to be here 
	and of asserting their place in the community. Our liberties will be strengthened 
	if our identity is protected from theft; if we are guaranteed access to the 
	services to which we are entitled; and if our community is better protected 
	from terrorists and organised criminals, and from those who seek to abuse 
	the immigration rules and public services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not need a card to 'assert my place in the community' - and I definitely 
  do not need a license to exist from the Government. It presents ID cards in 
  such a way as to appeal to xenophobia and play to people's fears, yet has consistently 
  failed to show exactly how they will significantly address any of the problems 
  mentioned. This is about being seen to be doing something, not about actually 
  tackling a number of complex and largely unrelated problems.</p>
<p>We are already entitled to the public services for which we pay and adding 
  in a massively complex and unproven technocratic barrier to access is no way 
  to guarantee anything. What we really have to fear in a world of State-issued 
  'entitlement' cards is denial of service through administrative error, network 
  failure, computer crashes - problems that occur with every large Government 
  IT project, or wherever technology is blindly used to replace trust.</p>
<p>A short civics lesson for Mssrs Blair, Clarke et al. - civil liberties are 
  what protect us from the arbitrary exercise of power <strong>by the state</strong>.</p>
<p> They cannot be sacrificed for the convenience of bureaucrats or politicians 
  seeking re-election. It is fraudulent to assert that our liberties are being 
  curtailed by fraudsters, criminals, illegal immigrants or terrorists when it 
  is, in fact, the Government doing this itself.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6909.asp"> 
  <p>ID fraud is a growing crime, costing the country more than &pound;1.3 billion 
	per year. Multiple or false identities are used in more than a third of terrorist 
	related activity and in organised crime and money laundering.</p>
  <p> It is crucial that we are able to confirm and verify our own and others' 
	identities quickly and easily. Consequently, we believe that there are clear 
	benefits to be gained from biometric identity cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Centralising all our information and issuing everyone with identity numbers 
  is likely to lead to an <strong>increase</strong> in identity fraud - i.e. the 
  Government's proposed solution would make the problem worse. This has been the 
  experience in the US and Australia, where one State-assigned number could be 
  used to connect all sorts of information about a person.</p>
<p>The vast majority of what the Government calls ID fraud is 'card not present' 
  credit card and internet-related (e.g. phishing) fraud that ID cards can do 
  nothing to stop. The figure quoted is a two year old guesstimate - for more 
  detail see <a href="http://www.spy.org.uk/spyblog/archives/2005/01/pathetic_govern.html">Spy 
  Blog's commentary on this.</a></p>
<p>If the Government is going to spend billions on a measure that it portrays 
  as tackling serious crime and terrorism it should explain precisely what ID 
  cards are going to do to stop or deter the two thirds of terrorists who, by 
  its own figures, use their own identities and legal identity documents. ID cards 
  have been sold as the answer to a whole host of problems - but, in reality, 
  it appears that they will be AT BEST nothing more than a partial solution for 
  the most serious of them, and offer no deterrent at all.</p>
<p>The Government imply that biometrics will make ID cards more secure and convenient. 
  Home Office representatives have used words like 'unforgeable' and 'infallible' 
  but biometric technologies are all fallible and, as applied in the proposed 
  ID scheme, will potentially discriminate against hundreds of thousands of British 
  citizens. Biometric enrollment alone will be deeply inconvenient for the fifth 
  of the population who live in rural locations.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page6909.asp"> 
  <p>The Government's proposals are designed to safeguard, not erode, civil liberties 
	by protecting people's true identity against fraud and by enabling them to 
	prove their identity more easily when accessing public or private services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the proposals are designed to safeguard civil liberties, then why is every 
  single civil liberties group up in arms about them? No Government will <strong>ever</strong> 
  have our 'true' identities, though it may assign registered ones. The Home Office 
  can protect nothing if, for example, they are not held fully accountable for 
  the correctness and use of the data in the Register and on the cards. The Bill 
  has been criticised on this basis time and again - including by the Home Affairs 
  Select Committee.</p>
<p>Linking ID cards to a national database and tracking every use of the card 
  constructs the architecture of a surveillance state, something that the Government's 
  own Information Commissioner warns us of - and it can give no guarantees about 
  how this might be used in 10 years time, in 20, in 50...</p>
<p>If the Government's proposals were truly beneficial or convenient, it would 
  not be resorting to criminalising people's identity in order to force them onto 
  the system.</p>
<p>The Government cannot simply redefine civil liberties to suit its own agenda. 
  Despite changing tack so many times, it has failed to prove the case for ID 
  cards for any given purpose - and refuses to talk openly about the massive database 
  and surveillance infrastructure required to administer its proposed scheme.</p>
<p>We note that 10 Downing Street chose to avoid any mention of costs, these having 
  risen from the original &pound;1.3 - 3.1 billion to &pound;5.5 billion on the 
  publication of the Regulatory Impact Assessment with the Bill. They may have 
  decided to ignore principled objections to their plans but are going to find 
  it a great deal harder to get away with what is, in reality, <strong>nothing 
  less than an Identity Tax</strong>.</p>
