  	<p>It's not too late. You CAN do something. And we need your help.</p>
  
        <p>If people look behind 'ID cards' at the
        whole National Identity Scheme, and say they don't want flat
        plastic lives fit for an official file &#8211; we win.</p>

        <p>If ID is discussed at every breakfast table, in every pub,
        and every club in the North West and across London &#8211; we win.</p>
	
        <p>Before the government introduced its ID legislation, around
        80% of people thought ID cards might be a good idea. Once they
        find out what 'ID cards' really mean, over 50% think they are
        a bad idea. The Home Office has no arguments. Its answer to
        questions is not to say more, but to repeat the empty claims
        it made before. And to waste millions shoving ID cards down
        our throats.</p>

        <p>Tell your friends. Tell your enemies, too. This is
        something that matters to everyone. If someone isn't worried,
        they haven't understood.</p>
