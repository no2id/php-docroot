		<p><strong>Lancaster NO2ID group meeting and street stall</strong> - following a successful street stall a couple of weeks ago, and with the return of more clement weather, we are planning a NO2ID meeting with a street stall to follow (weather permitting).</p>
		<p>The meeting will be, as previously, an informal and friendly discussion about all recent progressions in the ID card scheme and the NO2ID campaign - an excellent way for new members to meet some like-minded people and for everyone to keep up-to-date with, and discuss what's happening nationally, and what you feel should be happening locally. Lots of good campaign suggestions were raised last time, and hopefully we'll be able to build and expand upon those.</p>
		<p>The meeting will start at approximately 12 noon on Saturday 20th March, in The Robert Gillow, Market Street Lancaster - <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/places/gb/lancaster/market-st/64/-the-robert-gillow?gl=uk">MAP HERE</a>.

    <p><strong>Manchester NO2ID Street Stall</strong> on 12th December, 2:00pm
    &#8594; 4:00pm, St. Ann's Square in Manchester City Centre (down near the big
    Marks &amp; Spencer).<br />Many people have fallen for Home Office spin that the
    National Identity Scheme has been cancelled, that it isn't a threat or is
    voluntary. It's more important than ever to get the word out about the Database
    State. Manchester NO2ID will be running a public information stall to raise
    awareness about the ID Card Con. Feel free to join us to lend a hand or just
    chat. You don't need any experience or equipment, just a bit of time to spare
    and a friendly smile. This will be our first stall after the 
    <acronym title="United Kingdom Identity and Passport Service">UKIPS</acronym> 
    office opens at Westminster House, and the last stall
    before Christmas. We're sure to have a busy time with the Christmas Market in
    town &#8211; so a big turnout will definitely be welcome.</p>
