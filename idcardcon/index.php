    style="float:left; margin:8px 8px 8px 0;" /></a>The government 
    has announced that people in Greater Manchester and the North West, and young people aged 16-24 living in London are now "able" to register for an ID card.</p>

    <p><strong>Why pick on you?</strong> 
    The government thought it could force people working at Manchester and London City airports to be guinea-pigs for the national ID card.
    It was wrong. The airlines and unions saw no benefits and said 'NO'. The government backed down. Next it thought it could fool people in the
North West into being guinea-pigs. It was wrong again. Only a handful have applied. But it is not giving up. Now it says you need ID to buy a drink, so this will make people want to volunteer.</p>

    <p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong> The government is charging &#163;30 for the card, but is spending far more to sell each one. It admits the whole scheme will cost billions &#8212; hundreds of pounds a person. Once registered you'll have to keep paying every 10 years, and you'll be liable for fees and penalties for the rest of your life &#8212; up to &#163;1000 for failing to notify when your details change. Soon, you'll have to pay to be fingerprinted. No-one knows the costs if you lose your card or if it's stolen. Or the cost to you if the computer ever says 'NO'...</p>
	
    <p><strong>It's not the card, it's the database.</strong> The ID card itself is a distraction. We all carry 'ID'. You can already buy a legitimate proof-of-age card for under a tenner. The ID scheme is all about forcing you onto the National Identity Register, the ID database.
Numbering and tracking you, indexing your relationships (your bank, your GP, your passport, your tax...) and passing your information around Whitehall. Once on the database, you can never get off.</p>

    <p><strong>Stop the ID Card Con &#8211; inform yourself, and tell
    others:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>DON'T BE A GUINEA PIG &#8211; REFUSE TO REGISTER</strong></p>
