<h1>Other things you can do</h1>

<p>Like any campaign we need funds and people. Any help or expertise
   of any kind you can spare will be most welcome. Most important is 
   to get other people involved and to understand the issues. 
   <strong>ID-cards sound innocent</strong>. When people know that 
   they (and their children) may be fingerprinted like criminals 
   and will be made to register every change of address with the 
   authorities, their attitude changes. So:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tell your friends about the campaign and that you are 
      supporting it. Most people are scarcely aware of the government's ID
      database project, and few understand the dangers. Feel free to
      redistribute any of our materials to acquaintances. (Please do
      introduce it personally and don't spam.) Your personal witness will help
      others understand that this is important.</li>

  <li>Take <a href="/pledge">the NO2ID Pledge</a> and encourage 
      your friends and (adult) family to do so to. Display your
      copy with pride. Tell them you are not a number.</li>

  <li><a href="mailto:enquiries&#x40;no2id.net">Let us know</a> if
      you have time or special expertise that you can give to the 
      organisation or facilities you can lend us. The campaign is getting
      bigger, but needs to grow some more. Fast. We urgently need any
      assistance you can offer. We can use any amount of professional creative
      and marketing expertise as we begin to lift public awareness of the
      issues, but it would be handy to have reliable people to answer the
      phone.  Volunteer at
      <a href="mailto:volunteer&#x40;no2id.net">volunteer&#x40;no2id.net</a></li>

  <li>Get together with others in your area to form a local group. A national
      campaign needs a national network. Our experienced campaigners (
      <a href="mailto:local.groups&#x40;no2id.net">local.groups&#x40;no2id.net</a>)
      are available to help local groups build our nationwide presence. They
      can tell you how to hold a public meeting, set out your stall locally
      (literally as well as metaphorically), and how to get other people
      involved. If you have experience of local campaigns then by all means
      just start one &#8212; we will offer what help we can. Details of
      forthcoming meetings, when we have them, are posted on <a
      href="/events/">the events page</a>. <a href="/localgroups/">List of
      existing local groups</a>.</li>

  <li>Raise the issue for discussion in any organizations you belong to.
      Everyone is affected in some way. Encourage any club, union or other group
      you are in that opposes ID control to <a href="/about/supporters">become
      a supporter or affiliate itself</a>.</li>

  <li>Write to the local and national press, to express your concerns whenever 
	there is relevant news. Phone-in to appropriate radio and TV programs. There 
	is plenty of information on this website to help you do this.</li>
	
  <li>Write to your MP and MEP expressing your disquiet and ask for <em>their 
	personal</em> opinion. (Big-party MPs in particular sometimes avoid controversial 
	issues, or may pass on your letter to the Home Office rather than answering 
	for themselves.) <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a> is a 
	free and confidential way to get an answer. 
	<a href="mailto:enquries&#x40;no2id.net">Let us know</a> what they say.</li>
</ol>
