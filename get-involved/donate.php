<h1>Donate to NO2ID</h1>

<br />
  <p>When NO2ID started in 2004, we had no money, no base of operations &mdash;
  and the government said it intended to spend &pound;3.1 billion introducing
  ID cards. Now, as we all know, it is going to spend a <strong>lot</strong>
  more...</p> 
  
  <p>To date, the government has spent at least <strong>&pound;200
  million</strong> of taxpayers' money on the ID programme. NO2ID &mdash; spending
  less in total than what the Home Office paid the ID programme consultants
  <em>in a single month</em> &mdash; has not only run a high profile,
  controversy-stirring campaign in the media and Westminster, but we've built
  and continue to support a growing UK-wide network of local groups and
  activists, and have helped shift public opinion against 'ID cards' by
  30%.</p> 
  
  <p><strong>Please help us do more!</strong></p> 
  
  <p>Our office in London is run
  entirely from <a href="join">membership subscriptions</a> and donations,
  and our monthly mail bill (providing local groups and supporters around the
  UK with low-cost and free campaign materials) is even more than our rent.
  Effective campaigning costs money, and we make sure that we squeeze every
  last pound for maximum effect.</p> 
  
  <p>Donations can be made via PayPal. Please give what you feel you can

<p>Many thanks to all those who have generously supported the campaign over
  the past four years. Without your help, we wouldn't be here today. Please do
  encourage your friends and colleagues to join NO2ID, as we take the fight
  against ID cards and the database state across the nation and right to the
  heart of government.</p> <br />
