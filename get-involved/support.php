<h1>Support Us</h1>

<p>You can register your support by completing the form below.</p>

<?php require_once("../pageElements/nlsignUpForm.php");?>
    
<br />

<p>By signing up as a supporter you not only register your discomfort or
outrage at the government's proposed ID scheme, you'll be kept up to date with
the latest developments.</p>

<p>Registered supporters receive our 
   <a href="http://newsletters.mu.no2id.net">regular newsletter</a> 
   by email.<br />
   
   <strong>If you do not wish to receive the newsletter, 
   ignore the e-mail asking you to confirm subscription 
   that we send after you have submitted your details above.
   </strong> 
  
   <br />
  
   You will still be registered as a supporter, but will
   not receive our regular updates.</p>

<p>All details and e-mail addresses are kept confidential and will not be
   passed on to any third party. We value your privacy, unlike the Home
   Office.</p>
