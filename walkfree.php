<h1>Walking Free Across the Pennines</h1>

<p>"... I may be a wage slave on Monday, but I am a free man on 
Sunday..."</p>

<p>Ewan Maccol and countless other ramblers and wanderers felt that
great sense of freedom that walking anonymously over the tops and
dales of England in the twentieth century; I discovered this only a
couple of years ago scrambling up the southern reaches of Kinder
Scout. This is true freedom, a sort of primieval timeless liberty,
the sort of freedom generations of inhabitants of these islands have
been privy to and privledged by. Of course ID cards won't make a
difference to what the top of cross fell looks like, the rain on your
hat in Ribblesdale or the peaty quagmire of Black Hill. It won't
change the ache in your calves or the blisters on your feet, but the
existence of the ID card in your pocket is something of a
metaphysical challenge to all the ideals of the English people, an
aburupt and total obliteration of the quiet anonymity which we have
cherished for so long.</p>

<p>This is why I am walking the Pennine Way this year in aid of NO2ID,
for this year may be the last in which I can traverse the spine of
this beautiful free land and truly be on my own.</p>
