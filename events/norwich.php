<h1>NO2ID Voter Education Tour - coming to an ID card-supporting politician's
marginal seat near YOU!</h1>
<p>Until the election, NO2ID will be campaigning across the country, seditiously
		spreading the facts about ID cards, the National Identity Register and the
		dangers of database Britain. Starting now!</p>
<p>Day 1 of the Voter Education Tour comes to Norwich, where Home Secretary Charles
		Clarke occupies the marginal seat of Norwich South.</p>
<p>Incidentally, MP for Norwich North is Dr. Ian Gibson, a man of conscience
		who has voted consistently against ID cards, and Norwich City Council was the
		first to pass a motion condemning the ID card scheme and affiliate to NO2ID.</p>
<p>Should this represent the mood of the city, then already the Home Secretary
		has his work cut out for him. And to drive the point home, NO2ID will be handing
		out thousands of flyers and stickers to the people of Norwich outside City
		Hall, St. Peter's Street from 12 midday, showing how much ID cards will cost
		them in money, taxes and lost liberties.</p>
<p>The campaign will be joined in Norwich South by prospective candidates for
		the constituency, from the Liberal Democrat, UKIP and Green parties, allowing
		voters to have words with those that may well be representing them in the near
		future.</p>
<p>Around the country, irrespective of party, NO2ID will be ensuring that MPs
		who failed to support their constituents' rights and privacy by passing unfettered
		such an illiberal bill will be punished at the polls.</p>
