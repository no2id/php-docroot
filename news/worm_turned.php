<h1>Is the worm turning against authoritarian legislation?</h1>
<p>On the same day that the date of the general election was announced, Charles
		Clarke confirmed that the ID Cards Bill would be dropped &ndash; until after
		the election. Instead the government is likely to concentrate on ensuring other
		legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill is complete
		before Parliament is dissolved.</p>
<p>That Bill is not uncontroversial itself, so perhaps coming just weeks after
		the all-night session that was required to pass the Prevention of Terrorism
		Act, and observing the speed with which the government has rammed these, the
		ID Cards Bill and others through the Commons, it is no surprise to see members
of the Labour faithful registering their unease.</p>
<p>A Labour party prospective candidate and councillor from Lancashire has resigned
		from the Labour party and switched allegiances to the Liberal Democrats, stating
		his reasons to be the &ldquo;increasingly authoritarian&rdquo; nature of the
		government.</p>
<p>Stephen Wilkinson, who will not be standing for election, said:</p>
<blockquote>
		<p>&ldquo;I felt that the Labour Party has become much more authoritarian, that
				there is a total lack of interest in terms of individual rights within the
				country. I don&rsquo;t agree with Identity cards &ndash; I seriously oppose
				them &ndash; and the idea of people being locked up in their own homes without
				a court case and proper trial is ridiculous. I just physically didn&rsquo;t
				feel I could be part of the Labour party.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilkinson joins the ranks of other dismayed Labour voters, Labour councillors
		who voted for motions rejecting ID cards, and twenty-five Labour MPs who voted
		against the Bill in Parliament. Not to mention the many members of the Commons
		Home Affairs Select Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Lords
		Select Committee on the Constitution who have all come to the conclusion that
		the scheme is a shocker.</p>
Those politicians from all parties who insist on inflicting upon the UK this
unworkable, illiberal, ineffective and dangerous scheme would be wise to reflect
the turning tide of public opinion against them and the tenuous nature of their
jobs in the coming weeks.
