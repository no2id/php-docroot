<h1>NO2ID launches &pound;1,000,000 pledge</h1>
<p>Last week NO2ID's Refuse pledge was signed by over 10,000 people who will refuse to submit themselves to the proposed National Identity Register, after only one month. That number is still rising - past 10,500 - and the pledge will remain open until October (click the banner above). Every UK citizen that refuses to cooperate with the proposed identity system is a further thorn in the side of a project that is already too expensive, dangerous, unwieldy and unpopular.</p>
<p>This week NO2ID has launched a second pledge, at <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/resist">www.pledgebank.com/resist</a>,
which seeks 50,000 people to pledge &pound;20, generating a &pound;1,000,000 legal fighting fund to support those that choose to refuse. The pledge was launched by Franky Ma, a young mother living in London, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;As the mother of a young child I can't risk her rights with mine by contesting ID cards directly, but I want to do everything I can to make sure she grows up in a free country.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pledge is open until 31st March next year, and seeks support from those who for personal or professional reasons cannot risk falling outside the system by refusing to be registered into the national database.</p>
<p>NO2ID General Secretary, Guy Herbert said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The British public will not stand for the pointless bullying bureaucracy of a National Identity Register. It is unworkable. The 10,000 are merely the first cohort of those who will fail to comply. By pledging support now people can forestall this insanely wasteful scheme.</p>
  <p>&quot;The Home Office thinks it has Franky and millions like her over a barrel. 
  The prospect of massive penalties, being forbidden to travel, and being locked out of a livelihood or public services, for just not wanting to have this government license to live, means refusal for her is not an option. But her support will let others sustain the fight.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government should choose to save us, themselves and the public purse a huge amount of trouble by dropping the Identity Cards Bill now, before it inevitably unravels at the cost of tens of billions.</p>
