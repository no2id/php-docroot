<h1> Government in disarray over ID cards, prepares for an onslaught of spin</h1>
<p> It&rsquo;s nice when you are proved right. </p>
<p> NO2ID have been saying from the outset that the Government have been making outrageous and unjustified claims for their ID scheme. Last week the Minister for ID cards, Tony McNulty, agreed - confirming <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1542191,00.html">his earlier comments that the Government had &quot;oversold&quot; the benefits of ID cards</a>.</p>
<p> &quot;In their enthusiasm&quot; for all of the benefits the scheme would bring to the State, they forgot that it will be us citizens who have to pay for this - and submit to being scanned, registered and tracked for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p> Of course, these admissions don&rsquo;t mean that they are now going to drop the scheme and halt the Bill &ndash; that would be far too honourable and responsible. Instead we can probably expect a whole new line-up of reasons and excuses, as the Home Office try desperately to market their bankrupt ID plans on the basis of their &quot;benefit to the citizen&quot;.</p>
<p> Identity fraud is bound to feature heavily, and we may even see them using such desperate ploys as the paedophile argument &ndash; needing to register and track all teachers, nursery and play assistants and social workers in order to try and root out the <em>evil within</em>. Marketing based on fear and playing to prejudice.</p>
<p> Their words may change, but their intention remains clear.</p>
<p>We can certainly expect an artificial cap on the price of an ID card, that will have no effect whatsoever on the total cost of the scheme. And which will fool no-one, least of all Gordon Brown - who finally seems to be <a href="http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1740852005">waking up to the rising cost of the ID Bill</a>.</p>
<p> There&rsquo;s no sign as yet of Andy Burnham&rsquo;s promised ID card roadshow - Mr Burnham plays Robin to Tony McNulty&rsquo;s Batman &ndash; but keep an eye out in your area for NO2ID activity. We&rsquo;re lining up to catch certain MPs on their home turf, in their constituencies and at party conferences, before they head back to Parliament.
