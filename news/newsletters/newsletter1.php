    <p>This is the first of a planned series of regular email newsletters 
      to keep you informed about the campaign against the Home Office's plans 
      to fingerprint and track the entire population of Britain for its National 
      Identity Register. As soon as practicable the NO2ID Newsletter will also 
      be produced in printed form to let us reach people without email. Meanwhile, 
      if you want to forward this email to friends or print and distribute hard 
      copies, then we have no objections.</p>
    <p>You've been sent this (if you are a first hand recipient) 
      because we believe you registered as a supporter of the campaign. If not, 
      or if you just don't want the newsletter, let us know and please accept 
      our apologies. We don't want to spam anyone.</p>
    <p>(Equally, if you were a supporter in the past, but have now 
      decided that you do want yourself and your family to be tagged like cattle 
      at huge and unnecessary expense, please let us know.)</p>

    <h2><a name="thanks"></a>Thank you - A message from Mark Littlewood, 
      National Coordinator</h2>
    <p>It has been a slow start, I know, but the NO2ID organisation 
      is now up and running, and I believe we have a fighting chance of stopping 
      Britain becoming the world's first &quot;database state&quot;. We wouldn't 
      have got this far without the support of numerous volunteers and supporters. 
      Unlike our opponents, nobody is making a living doing this. Some supporters 
      who are politicians, civil servants, or work for big IT contractors, would 
      have an easier life if they accepted Mr Blunkett's glib assurances and took 
      advantage of the public money gravy train being hauled by such a vast<br>
      project. Everyone involved so far in the smallest way or the largest is<br>
      giving their time freely for personal liberty and the public good. So before 
      asking you for yet more help, it is worth pausing to say thank-you to everyone 
      who has supported the campaign so far.</p>
    <p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>

    <h2><a name="whatHappened"></a>What just happened?</h2>
    <p>The Home Office's latest consultation exercise, that on its 
      <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/inside/consults/current/index.html">Draft 
      Bill</a>, has just closed. It will take a while to &quot;consider&quot; 
      the result, but the conclusion is predictable: Responses will be said to 
      have been broadly in favour of the proposals. Some valuable technical points 
      will have been made that will be &quot;taken into account&quot; in legislative 
      proposals.</p>
    <p>We believe that the whole consultation process has been a 
      sham. So, apparently, does David Blunkett. The Scotsman newspaper reported--before 
      the period for submissions to the consultation closed:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=826372004"> 
      <p>Mr Blunkett's officials also confirmed that, as Liberty 
        and other campaigners had warned, the planned national identity-card system 
        would form the foundation of a central data collecting and monitoring 
        system.</p>
      <p>Once the database for the biometric data stored on the cards 
        is established, it will be linked to the likes of the Police National 
        Computer, Interpol and the security services' &quot;warnings index&quot; 
        of those believed to be a threat to national security.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As well as jumping the gun, this substantially extends the 
      scope of what has been proposed. It has never before been admitted that 
      the so-called id-database is to be linked to others. It is rather interesting 
      that access to the information on the register might be available to foreign 
      governments through Interpol, and that people may be flagged as &quot;believed 
      to be a threat to national security&quot; by the security services.</p>
    <p>Is the public process on one page, and the secret process 
      on another?</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, we believe it is important to show opposition 
      in detail as well as in principle. NO2ID presented a lengthy response to 
      the consultation, which will soon be available for download on <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">the 
      website</a>:</p>
    <p>On the plus side, NO2ID is formally established, has a bank 
      account, and the backing of a lot of committed people. Starting from scratch 
      only a few months ago, we are catching up the Home Office's 20-year start. 
      We are supported by respected organisations such as Liberty, Charter 88 
      and Privacy International, and several political parties (though the Conservatives, 
      as a party, are sitting on the fence)--<a href="/content/supporters.html">see 
      the website for details</a>.</p>
    <p>A public meeting &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; was held at 
      the LSE on 19th May, organised by Privacy International and supported by 
      several other organisations. It was judged a great success by those who 
      attended. There was some positive press coverage. It certainly wasn't intended 
      as a rally, but any supporters of the database state failed to turn up. 
      The Home Office in particular refused all inducement to take part, and no 
      official spokesman for the Labour Party was available. (Though as individuals 
      Labour MPs and Peers made their presence felt--for the anti-government side.)</p>
    <p>David Davis, Shadow Home Secretary, in a thoughtful speech, said he was 
      undecided but would be in favour of ID-cards if they would stop terrorism. 
      (Since it can be shown they won't, it looks like Mr Davis may well be persuadable 
      to our part of the argument.) There were many impressive contributions among 
      them a deeply considered speech in opposition to the system from the Law 
      Society.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/conference/missingid/">Full 
      list of speakers, none of whom one could call a zealous advocate.</a></p>
    <p> Mr Blunkett should not be able to get away with characterising his opponents 
      as--in that revealing turn of phrase--&quot;the usual suspects&quot;. This 
      can be an establishment campaign. We are defending traditional rights and 
      freedoms.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>You are probably aware of the <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/">poll 
      recently conducted by YouGov for Privacy International</a>. Government research 
      has confined itself to asking people vaguely if they think ID CARDS are 
      a Good Thing, allowing them to be triumphant about getting a majority 'yes'. 
      The PI Poll shows something much more interesting.</p>
    <p>The more people know about the project, and the National Identity Register, 
      the less they like it. And opposition is substantial. We are not alone.</p>
    <p>If you scale up the number of people who say they'd rather go to jail than 
      carry a compulsory ID card from the poll sample, then there are approximately 
      3 MILLION people for the Home Office to fine and jail. Maybe this is why 
      the plan is for the scheme to be introduced gradually at first--and by stealth.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h2> <a name="whatNext"></a>What's Next?</h2>
    <p>The Parliamentary Select Committee on Home Affairs reports on Identity 
      Cards at the end of this month. Like all committees it has a government 
      majority, but we know that there are a significant number of sceptics of 
      all parties on the Committee. It should make interesting reading.</p>
    <p>The Queen's Speech is in November. The last one announced the Draft Bill, 
      and we expect an actual ID Bill announced in it this time round. However, 
      it is possible that it will be timetable for the autumn regardless, to give 
      it the maximum time to get through before a prospective general election 
      (which most commentators believe will be some time towards the end of the 
      first half of next year).</p>
    <p>We are reasonably confident that the Bill, when it comes, can be stopped 
      in the Lords--though that will take work. There was no mandate for it in 
      the government's last election manifesto, so the Lords has every reason 
      to exercise a restraining power on such a profound measure. After the General 
      Election, it is likely that the Labour government will be returned again, 
      in which case it seems very likely that the population database will be 
      back, perhaps under yet another new name.</p>
    <p>But if we can create delay we will have gained some time to bring the myriad 
      problems and oppressive details to public attention.</p>
    <h2><a name="stopPress"></a>Stop press</h2>
    <p> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1190990,00.html">A 
      disturbing leak to the Sunday Times - a database of all children</a>.</p>
    <p> This fills a mysterious gap since the Blunkett Draft Bill doesn't appear 
      to cover children, AND it appears to be going to be introduced without warning 
      as an amendment on an existing Bill, AND it is proposed as a database not 
      just of children's names and addresses, but familial and other personal 
      details including prejudicial facts (possibly even rumours) about family 
      members. So if this is real and not just kite-flying, it will violate several 
      assurances we've been given about the National ID Register--before the Register 
      itself is even in existence.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h2><a name="takeAction"></a>What you can do about it</h2>
    <p> Like any campaign we need funds and people. Any help or expertise of any 
      kind you can spare will be most welcome. Most important is to get other 
      people involved and to understand the issues. ID-CARDS sound innocent. When 
      people know that they (and their children) may be fingerprinted like criminals 
      and will be made to register every change of address with the secret police, 
      their attitude changes. So:-</p>
    <p>1. Tell your friends about the campaign and that you are supporting it. 
      Feel free to redistribute this newsletter to acquaintances. (But please 
      do introduce it personally and don't spam.) Your personal witness will help 
      others understand that this is an important real-life matter, and not just 
      the province of hyper-political nuts.</p>
    <p>2. Let us know if you have time or special expertise that you can give 
      to the organisation, even if only a couple of hours a week. We desperately 
      need an experienced Press Officer, secretarial staff, and policy researchers. 
      Professional creative and marketing expertise are badly wanted to lift public 
      awareness of the issues.</p>
    <p>3. Get together with others in your area to form a local group. A national 
      campaign needs a national network. <a href="mailto:guy&#x40;no2id.net">Guy Taylor</a> 
      can give you advice on how to do this. If you are in London come to the 
      open, pub-based, meetings that we hold every month on a Thursday somewhere 
      central. Details are posted on the website.</p>
    <p>4. Write to the local and national press, to express your concerns whenever 
      there is relevant news. Phone-in to appropriate radio and TV programs. There 
      is plenty of information on (and linked to) the website to help you do this.</p>
    <p>5. Write to your MP and MEP expressing your disquiet and ask for _their 
      personal opinion_. (Big-party MPs in particular sometimes avoid controversial 
      issues, or may pass on your letter to the Home Office rather than answering 
      for themselves.)</p>
    <p>6. Buy a T-shirt, and wear it. This publicises the message--people will 
      ask you what it means--and raises funds. <a href="/content/tshirt_order.html">Details

    <p>7. Join. Membership costs &pound;15 a year and entitles you to a say in 
      the running of NO2ID. A membership form will appear on the website shortly.</p>
    <p>8. Give generously. A few weeks back we had no money. Now we have next 
      to no money. The Home Office is planning to spend billions. But we will 
      spend your money better. Direct payments to HSBC Account in the name of
