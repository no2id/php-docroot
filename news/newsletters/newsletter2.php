<h1>NO2ID News No.2</h1>
<p><em>13 August 2004</em></p>
<p>This is the second regular email bulletin to keep you informed 
        about the campaign against the Home Office's plans to fingerprint and 
        track the entire population of Britain for its National Identity Register. 
        As soon as practicable NO2ID NEWS will also be produced in printed form 
        to let us reach people without email. Meanwhile, if you want to forward 
        this email to friends or print and distribute hard copies, then we have 
        no objections.</p>

<h2><a name="agm"></a>NO2ID Public Launch and Inaugral AGM</h2>
      <p>Though Mark Littlewood has been interviewed a number of times in his 
        role as National Coordinator, and we have had a presence at related events, 
        NO2ID has yet to be officially launched. We therefore open our public 
        campaign proper on <strong>Saturday 18th September</strong> with a rally 
        for supporters in central London and simultaneous smaller events elsewhere 
        in the country.</p>
      <p>You should shortly receive an invitation to the London rally, which will 
        consist of a meeting at a central location, followed by lunch and some 
        afternoon publicity activities. If you are elsewhere and would like to 
        attend, or to organise, something more local, please contact <a href="mailto:guy&#x40;no2id.net">Guy 
        Taylor</a> who can give you help and advice.</p>
      <p>NO2ID will be having its <strong>first Annual General Meeting on 9th 
        October</strong> in order formally to adopt its constitution and to elect 
        officers. As it is an unincorporated association, each paid-up member 
        of NO2ID will have a vote. Individual membership is open to anyone who 
        supports our aims and who pays an annual membership fee. Membership starts 
        at 15 GBP (with an 8 GBP concessionary rate). We have deliberately set 
        the rate low to make membership affordable to as many people as possible, 
        but encourage you to pay what you feel you can afford. <a href="/content/join.html">Membership 
        forms are available on the NO2ID website</a>, or you can write in with 
        your name and address, enclosing a cheque for your membership fee to NO2ID. 
        It is our policy not to pass on the details of members and supporters 
        to any outside organisation.</p>

      <h2><a name="linton"></a>Wierd and wonderful- Mr Linton's Independant Scheme</h2>
      <p>Next time someone tells you they are in favour of ID-cards, question 
        them closely. They may have something different in mind from the Home 
        Office. Mr Martin Linton (Lab), MP for Battersea is a fervent fan. <a href="http://www.wandsworthguardian.co.uk/news/localnews/display.var.515511.0.survey_boost_for_id_card_scheme.php">According 
        to the Wandsworth Guardian</a> he has been surveying local residents on 
        their attitudes to ID-cards by the highly scientific method of a self-designed 
        and self-administered questionnaire. The trouble is... that Mr Linton's 
        ideas of the functions of an ID-card are entirely unlike (and very, very, 
        much more ambitious than) those on offer from the Home Office. To his 
        credit David Blunkett is not planning to track your public library borrowings 
        in the near future.</p>

      <h2><a name="happened"></a>What just happened?</h2>
      <p>NO2ID was well represented at Privacy International's Big Brother Awards 
        on 29th July at the LSE. Mark Thomas as host wore our colours for the 
        cameras, and a packed house bought our entire mobile stock of T-shirts. 
        <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/29/big_brother_awards/">Results 
        are available on the Register.</a></p>
      <p>The House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs reported on the 
        current ID proposals as expected on 30th July. Its report (endorsed by 
        a majority of 5-2, with the two dissenting members producing a minority 
        report) seemed puzzling to many observers.</p>
      <p>The Register summed up neatly: &quot;<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/30/id_card_report/">ID 
        cards: a bad idea, but we'll do it anyway</a>.&quot;</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmhaff.htm">The 
        official parliamentary site for the report itself</a>.</p>
      <p>Bob Russell and David Winnick's Minority Report appears as a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhaff/130/13012.htm">rejected 
        amendment</a> in the Formal Minutes at the end of the report.</p>
      <p>Most of the serious press seems to have got the &quot;bad idea&quot; 
        point, even if only on grounds of cost. Meanwhile, the Home Office merrily 
        got on with misrepresenting the cautious conclusions of the majority report 
        as thoroughgoing endorsement, and the views of critics as being favourable.

      <h2><a name="fundraising"></a>NO2ID Fundraising is now moving forward</h2>
      <p>Phil Booth, our Treasurer reports:<br>
        <q>I'm very pleased to announce that NO2ID has received a seed funding 
        grant from The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Ltd - many thanks to the Directors 
        and staff of the Trust for their support. Setting up and running a campaign 
        costs money and, while we wouldn't be anywhere without the time and effort 
        of our growing number of volunteers and supporters, it is crucial that 
        we are ready as soon as possible to distribute free-of-charge printed 
        materials and have a presence at key events.</q></p>
      <p><q>Thanks, too, to those who have <a href="/content/tshirt_order.html">bought 
        T-shirts</a> or taken out <a href="/content/join.html">full membership</a> 
        of NO2ID.</q></p>
      <hr/>
      <p>An honourable mention too to The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust's 'State 
        of the Nation' Poll, published a few weeks ago. Details here: </p>

      <li><a href="http://www.jrrt.org.uk/FINDINGS.pdf">Main Findings</a></li>
    </ul>
<p> Again, a properly conducted poll shows that support for ID-cards is 
        neither as uniform nor as strong as the government and other boosters 
        wish to suggest.</p>

      <p>We have a new address of our very own. Until now we've been relying on 
        the generous help of Privacy International. You can now contact us directly

      <h2><a name="next"></a>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>We will shortly be hitting the political conference season. As well as 
        our own events, there are already plans in train for us to hold a workshop 
        and have a stall at the European Social Forum and to stage a fringe meeting 
        at the Labour Party conference in Brighton. Anyone who'd like to help--particularly 
        Labour Party members who may be attending the Conference--please get in 
        touch.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Conservatives are in Blackpool this year from 4th- 7th October. On 
        ID-cards of late they have sounded more and more sceptical of Mr Blunkett's 
        vague assertions, despite apparently trying to keep up with the Government's 
        fierce &quot;law-and-order&quot; drive. We are actively working to encourage 
        and coordinate opposition from across the political spectrum, so watch 
        out for developments here. Polls do seem to show that Tory supporters 
        are more likely than average to be suspicious of the ID-system. Again 
        it would be good to hear from attendees.</p>
