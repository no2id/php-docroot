<hr/><h2><a name="213"></a>Sat, 28th Feb 2009 — Convention on Modern Liberty</h2>
eventID:213
        
        
We are entering a dangerous period in our country. Economic turmoil threatens profound hardship and disharmony. Disenchantment with politics is growing and even legitimate protest is threatened by an unprecedented programme of challenges to our rights, freedoms and democracy. Sixty years ago Britain was a proud co-author of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Now it is increasingly centralized, abandoning its historic principles some of which date back to the Magna Carta.<br /><br />On Saturday 28th February NO2ID, along with other UK civil liberties organisations, will be hosting Convention on Modern Liberty events across the UK and in London. The convention will ask three broad questions:<br /><br />
* Are our freedoms and rights threatened by an over-powerful state and if so how do we defend ourselves from this&#8204;<br />
* Are dangers to our security from terrorism and other threats, from climate change to pandemics being used to attack our rights, and how can we best defend ourselves&#8204;<br />
* How can we arouse sustained public interest&#8204;<br /><br />The main event will take place at the Logan Hall but simultaneously meetings with live video feeds from London will take place in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Manchester, Cambridge and Bristol.<br /><br /><strong>NO2ID is looking for volunteer stewards for Logan Hall on the 28th February, all day.</strong> The Convention on Modern Liberty is a huge, high profile event involving a wide range of people, all concerned about the attacks on our freedom. We expect it to be not only an exciting and important event, but a fantastic opportunity for NO2ID to reach new supporters.<br /><br />If you would be able to act as a steward on the 28th Feb, please contact Matty on <a href="mailto:local.groups@no2id.net&#8204;subject=Modern Liberty volunteer"><strong>local.groups@no2id.net</strong></a>. You'll get to see a lot of the panels, debates and break-out sessions and we'll feed you too. Please help us make our mark on this important event.<br /><br />More details here: <strong><a href="http://www.modernliberty.net">http://www.modernliberty.net</a></strong>

eventID:194
<br/><u>Public Discussion: "David Davis and the Surveillance State" </u><br/><u>Monday 7th July,Tonbridge & Tunbridge Wells NO2ID</u><br /><br />Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells NO2ID will host a public discussion on growing concerns about the Database State as highlighted by David Davis, the Shadow Home Secretary, in his resignation statement. A statement from David Davis to the meeting will be delivered by Iain Dale, top Tory blogger. The discussion will take place in The Angel Centre on Monday, 7th July and is open to all. NO2ID is single-issue, is non-partisan (not party-political), and welcomes all comers irrespective of party-political position or stance on civil liberties and privacy issues. The discussion is intended to be broader than the NO2ID remit of "Database State" and is open to all with discussions on broader Surveillance State concerns.<br /><br />In his resignation announcement, Mr Davis cited plans for the 'most intrusive identity card system in the world' and a 'database state opening up our private lives to the prying eyes of official snoopers and exposing our personal data to careless civil servants and criminal hackers'.<br /><br /> Those who would like to share their views on the government's plans for the Surveillance State, and the shifting boundary between state and individual, are most welcome to join in the discussion at the Angel Centre, Angel Lane, Tonbridge, TN9 1SF, 7.30- pm on Monday, 7th July.<br/>

The biometrics industry is often accused of neglecting the human element when designing their biometric schemes and of trampling on privacy. On the other hand, opposing groups are often unfair, or at least somewhat extreme in their negative assessment of the technology. In the middle sits the end user who will often be attracted to the idea of biometrics, but have concerns in their minds about issues, such as centralisation of their biometric data in large databases, or what happens if someone steals my biometric&#8204; This session brings together experts in the field and debates the highly-important issues at stake.<br /><br />Led by <strong>Emilio Mordini</strong>, Director of Italy's Centre for Science, Society and Citizenship and Coordinator of the BITE (Biometric Identification Technology Ethics) project<br /><strong>Russ Ryan</strong>, VP Information and Communication, National Biometric Security Project (NBSP), USA<br /><strong>Phil Booth</strong>, National Coordinator, NO2ID, UK<br /><strong>Hugh Carr-Archer</strong>, Head of Intellect's Biometrics group, UK<br /><strong>Jane Caplan</strong>, Professor of Modern European History, St Antony's College, University of Oxford, UK <br/>

<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> <strong>Background Information - Who
was Clarence Willcock&#8204;</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">In
December 1950 a traffic policeman in Finchley stopped a dry cleaner
named Clarence Willcock and asked him to produce his World War II
identity card.<span>  Mr Willcock replied, "I am a Liberal. I am against that sort of thing".</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><u>On 26th of June 1951</u>, in his final court appearance of the case, Clarence Willcock heard the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard, declare; &#8204;it is obvious that the police now, as a matter of routine, demand the production of national registration identity cards
whenever they stop or interrogate a motorist for whatever cause&#8204;<span>  To
use Acts of Parliament, passed for particular purposes during war, in
times when the war is past - tends to turn law-abiding subjects into
lawbreakers, which is a most undesirable state of affairs&#8204;.<span>  As
a result of this case and the Chief Justices stinging attack on police
abuse of identity cards, the law was abolished in 1952, by Winston
Churchill as a part of his &#8204;bonfire of controls&#8204;. </div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">So,
more then half a century later we feel, with the passing of the
Identity Card Act, that the need is greater now more then ever to
remember and celebrate the courage and victory of this one individual
over the powerful and intrusive state machine.<span>  It was stopped before &#8204; it can be stopped again!&#8204;</div>

<br/>"Britain now has more CCTV cameras than any other country, a

claims that we are 'sleepwalking into a surveillance society', while
the authorities

about. What implications does living in a 'surveillance society' have
for our public and private lives&#8204;" <br />

<br/>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, QC, MP, Henry Porter and Professor Ross Anderson consider where we go from here. The Identity Cards Act 2006 is law, and must be repealed, but meanwhile the government is already working on extending its scope, through "information sharing" across the public sector and an "Identity Management Action Plan" to be produced by the end of this year. What new threats does this offer to personal liberty&#8204; How can the slide to the database state be halted&#8204; <br/> Ross Anderson will also be discussing the NHS Confidentiality campaign, and how GPs can be persuaded to resist uploading your medical records to the national database.

The UK Home Office is currently consulting over plans to give the police powers to require the production of decryption keys and of plain text. They have also produced a draft code of practice on government access to "communications data" - phone numbers and e-mail addresses contacted, web sites visited, locations of mobile phones, etc. 'Scrambling for Safety 8' will bring together representatives from government, industry and human rights organisations to discuss these consultations with interested members of the public. This is the only such meeting during the consultation period, it is free to attend but space is limited. For more details go to (<a href="http://tinyurl.co.uk/2utt">http://tinyurl.co.uk/2utt</a>).

Melanie Skinner, NO2ID Inverness coordinator, will be delivering the results of a street survey on ID cards in the Highlands to Number 10 Downing Street at 3.00pm on Friday 13th January.<br /><br />In order to fairly guage opinion, members of the public were presented with a simple unbiased question, with no campaign T-Shirts or publicity materials on display. This 'free vote' indicates an almost complete reversal of the Government's claims for support - with 70% saying they were against ID cards and only 30% in favour.
        
        
<hr/><h2><a name="61"></a>Tue, 6th Dec 2005 — ID Card Debate: farewell to liberty&#8204;</h2>
eventID:61
        
<br/>Home Office minister Andrew Burnham MP will defend the Government's proposals.<br />Civil rights campaigner Peter Tatchell will put the case against ID cards.<br /><br />Tuesday 6 December, 6.45pm for 7pm<br />at the Forest Suite, Quality Hotel, West Street, Brighton (next to the Odeon).<br /><br />Entrance free.<br /><br />The Government claims that ID cards and the National Identity Register will help protect us against terrorism, combat identity theft and benefit fraud, and help make public services more efficient. Opponents of the scheme say it is an invasion of our privacy, a threat to our civil liberties and a waste of taxpayers' money that will not provide the benefits the Government claims for it. This is your chance to hear the Government minister responsible for ID cards defend his proposals at a public debate.

<br/>In stark contrast to the government's failure to openly discuss their proposals, No2ID will be holding a public meeting to discuss the contents and implications of the UK Identity Card Bill.
<br/>Taking place at the Old Cinema of the University of Westminster on June 29th at 7pm, speakers will include:
<ul>
<li>Rt Hon <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/tony_benn/chesterfield">Tony Benn</a></li>

<li>Director of <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/">Liberty</a>, Shami Chakrabarti;</li>
</ul>
<br/>Mark Littlewood (of No2ID) will be in the Chair
<br/>Discussions will pick up on the poorly publicised and less understood parts of the Identity Cards Bill that form the heart of the government's proposals: the National Identity Register, a vast database of over 60 million people's personal information and biometrics, and the audit trail that will record when and where any check is made on the Register, effectively building up a profile of a persons daily activity.
<br/>The meeting is free and open to all. However, space is limited.
<br/>No2ID welcomes anyone regardless of their previous knowledge or understanding of the issues, and especially urges those who are undecided or interested in knowing more to come along.

eventID:19
<br/><strong>The Government wants to reintroduce a compulsory identity card ...but did you know&#8204;</strong>
<ul><li>It would cost at least &#8204;6bn (&#8204;200 for every taxpayer), enough to pay for 30 large hospitals or 10,000 extra police for 10 years</li>
<li>You could be fined &#8204;1,000 or more if your card is lost or damaged, or you move house and forget to tell them</li><li>It wouldnt stop terrorists - the September 11th hijackers had valid ID</li>
<li>It would be a tool for racists. Asians and Black people often feel they are unfairly stopped and searched by police already. ID will give more reasons to check people</li><li>A government database containing your personal details would be accessible to thousands of people without your permission</li><li>The Government wants to make this law by May</li></ul>

<hr/><h2><a name="11"></a>Mon, 21st Feb 2005 — NO2ID Vigil for 53rd Anniversary of the abolition of identity cards in the UK</h2>
eventID:11
        
<br/>To celebrate the 53rd anniversary of the abolition of identity cards in the UK, and to mourn the ebbing away of our civil liberties under recent governments NO2ID will be holding a vigil in Parliament Square on Monday 21 February.
Meet at the foot of Winston Churchill's statue at 11am.
Please dress in black.
<br/>The vigil will last for one hour, and will be followed by a surprise activity in association with Liberty.
<hr />
<br/>The only period in British history when its subjects have been required to carry identity cards was between 1939 and 1952 as part of the National Registration Act 1939.
This was a piece of wartime emergency legislation that required "all persons in the United Kingdom at the appointed time" to be registered on a National Register and issued with identity cards.
The police had the right to demand citizens show their card, or present it "within such time, to such person and at such place as may be prescribed."
<br/>Despite having been brought in to deal with the extreme circumstances of the war, the identity card legislation was still in place in 1952, and police regularly requested its presentation from people who may not have done anything wrong.
On 7th December 1950, Clarence Henry Willcock, a manager in a dry cleaning company, was stopped by PC Harold Muckle while driving his car in Finchley.
No evidence has been given that Willcock committed any offence, but when ordered to present his identity card he refused.
He was convicted by magistrates under the 1939 act, and appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, where his case was heard by the Lord Chief Justice and six other Judges.
Although his conviction was upheld the National Registration Act was was denounced by the Lord Chief Justice as it tended "to turn law-abiding citizens into lawbreakers, which is a most undesirable state of affairs."
<br/>On 21<sup>st</sup> February 1952, as part of Churchill's "bonfire of controls", the government abolished the national identity cards with much support from the population.
<br/>Only fifty years later we see that the lessons of the past have been forgotten by a government apparently obsessed with modernisation.
Past abuses of the cards and populartion databases in the UK itself, as well as the more horrific uses they have been put to in even recent years, are ignored under the name of protecting us from various threats, both mundane and terrifying.
On this 53<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of the abolition of identity cards in the UK we should try to recall why our parents and grandparents breathed a sigh of relief at the lifting of a burden the government would return to our shoulders.

<h3>Migrant Workers’ Rights, Immigration Surveillance: the Challenges
    for 2005</h3>
<br/>A seminar presenting perspectives on the latest developments in immigration

    their views on the likely challenges facing JCWI in the year ahead.
<br/>We will be joined by:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Manjit Singh Gill QC</strong> leading counsel in immigration and
    
human rights law, 6 King’s Bench Walk</li>

    <li><strong>Megan Addis</strong> Legal Officer at Liberty, the civil liberties

</ul>
<br/>With ID cards on the agenda, and a society that is increasingly reliant upon,
    but widely hostile to, migrant workers, the panel will offer their views on
    the issues of concern to Britain’s migrant and settled communities in
    2005. 
<br/>Those attending the seminar will have an opportunity to put questions to
    the panel and participate in an audience debate.
