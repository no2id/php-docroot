		Mark Littlewood, the National Co-ordinator (pro. tem.) delivered an
		oral report; he explained that the meeting was to formalize our
		actions; and that challenges were ahead, including a Parliamentary
		&amp; Lobbying battle (and faith in the Lords will be essential);
		and for a rise in No2ID Members and supporters. A question was
		asked, from Albert Beale, regarding the groups/organizations
		affiliating, to which he was referred to the list in a contemporary
		pamphlet. Processes were still being formalized, but five (5)
		organizations had formally affiliated at this juncture.</P>
		<LI><P>
		Phil Booth, Treasurer (pro. tem.) made an interim financial report
		(Annex A), but mentioned that ways to increase funding are sought,
		and that various grant applications were pending. To aid in
		planning, members were encouraged to use Standing Orders for their
		dues. Gratitude was expressed to the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust
		Ltd., for their generosity and start-up grant. On lobbying
		exercises, contacts need to be enhanced: at all levels; and that
		printed materials need distributing. A Press advertisement for
		gaining membership/supporters was to be forthcoming. Questions were
		asked; including details of the Association's Bank Account (they're
		published on the website), and on how the Association was
		'pitching' itself to groups; a nominal affiliation fee was
		mentioned (which had been set at GBP30,-)</P>
		<LI><P>
		Adam McGreggor, Secretary (pro. tem.) gave an oral report detailing
		a continual rise in Membership and supporters, the latter obviously
		more so, following on from events. We had 201 self-identified
		'activists', and ca. 300 supporters. A sign-up form, on the
		website, had been working, but permitted incomplete data to slip
		in; particularly postcodes. This yielding ~600 others (some of whom
		may be duplicates). The Association's Data Protection Act
		registration was completed (PZ8746707 is our number). There were
		roughly 60 paid-up Members. Gratitude was expressed to Guy Herbert
		for his assistance in matters; and to James Cronin for his sterling
		efforts with the Constitution. A question was asked regarding
		webstats; details will be available, in due course, to those asking</P>
		<LI><P>
		General Questions (to the Officers) were asked; including how the
		Association will be targeting "older people", to which the
		pending Community Actions Projects (for which funding has been
		granted) will contribute to this endeavour.

	<LI><P>
	On Ratification of the Constitution: The Constitution was introduced
	to the Meeting as a document necessary (in one form or another) for
	the Association to maintain a bank account, and to function. An
	objection was made to the 'top-heavy' nature of the Advisory Board;
	which it was felt could benefit from a shape closer to NGOs' modus
	operandi. <BR>The Constitution was <B>ratified,</B><SPAN >
	with two members abstaining.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P>
	Elections to the Advisory Board (neither the Chair, nor the
	Vice-Chair posts were contested elections; three candidates stood
	for three ordinary seats on the Advisory Board)</P>

		For Chair, <B>Simon Davies</B>: Simon has been involved in Identity
		Cards since ca. 1986/87, with r&ocirc;les
		in the OzCard campaign, and more recently, with Privacy
		International. For the last eight years, Simon has been a Visiting
		Professor of the LSE and offered to bring strategic and
		organizational management skills to the post; his purpose would be
		in defeating the card and the database.</P>
		<LI><P>
		For Vice-Chair, <B>Debbie Chay</B>: With a past (and present) in
		Human Rights and Civil Liberties, Debbie has been involved in
		Charter 88, including some work with Matrix-Churchill.</P>

			Mark Dziecielewski: a computer security consultant, familiar with

			Totalitarian state, and believing that the Government's scheme is
