<h1>2006 Annual General Meeting</h1>
<p>Members of the Association are invited to join us at our Second Annual General Meeting, this February, in Pimlico, London.</p>

<p>Details of the meeting have been sent to all Members that we have contact addresses for. In addition to postal notification, we've also dropped all of our members an email.</p>

<p>More details for the day are to be published on this page, in due course; including electronic versions of the <a href="bundle/">Agenda Bundle</a> which we would encourage Members intent on attending to print a copy of; some paper copies will be available on the day, but only some. You may wish to periodically check this page for updates</p>

<p>To aid us in our planning, please could you <a href="mailto:agm2006&#x40;no2id.net">email us</a> or let us know if you will be coming; this will help us arrange the room and provide sufficient light refreshments.</p>

<p>In addition to the formal <acronym title="Annual General Meeting">AGM</acronym>, there will be am <a href="actionday.php">Action Day</a>, upon return from the lunch break; more details will be on that page. Any interested person may attend the Action Day, although we <strong>cannot</strong> advise of a starting time for that.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you at the AGM</p>
