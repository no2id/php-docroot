<p>If enough people say no, we can stop this happening. Tell other people. 
   Showing them <em>Take Jane</em> is an easy way to do it.</p>

<p>You can e-mail friends this link:</p>

<p><a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=v1JqlvnZANA">
   http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=v1JqlvnZANA</a> (just copy and 
   paste it or right-click "Copy Link Location" into the text 
   of your e-mail)</p>

<p>and <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=v1JqlvnZANA">YouTube lets you 
   embed the video in your blog or facebook / myspace / bebo page</a>. If 
   you want a copy of our press ad, it is <strong><a href="download">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Too many people still think of an ID card as just another piece of plastic. But 
   the more they find out about what the government is actually proposing, the less 
   they like it. Don't just read <a href="/IDSchemes/"><strong>NO2ID's analysis</strong></a>
   , but also <a href="http://www.ips.gov.uk/identity/publications-legislative.asp">what 
   the government says</a>. You can see the spin for yourself.</p>
   
<br />

<p>The other thing you can do is to support the NO2ID campaign directly or indirectly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/get-involved/support"><strong>Subscribe to NO2ID's 
        e-mail newsletter</strong></a>. We ask for your postal address 
	so that we can send you a FREE supporters pack with more information 
	about the ID scheme and NO2ID.</li>
   <li><a href="/localgroups/"><strong>Join (or start) a local group</strong></a> &#8212; 
       NO2ID supporters are from all sorts of backgrounds and most have never been 
       involved in a political campaign before. You will be welcome.</li>
   <li><a href="/get-involved/donate"><strong>Make a donation</strong></a>. Our campaign 
       is run by volunteers and a tiny staff, but lobbying and producing public 
       information costs money. Make a donation or 
       <a href="/get-involved/join"><strong>become a member of NO2ID</strong></a>. 
       Liberty is priceless. Any contribution you can make is valuable.</li>
</ul>
