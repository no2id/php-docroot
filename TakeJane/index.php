<p>NO2ID will be accused of scaremongering. But the <em>Take Jane</em> 
   video is a good deal less frightening than it might be, because we 
   wanted it to have widespread distribution.</p>

   It is likely that a 
   <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/feb/27/idcards.immigrationpolicy">
   <strong>National Identity Register</strong></a> &#8212; the database at the heart 
   of the 'ID cards' scheme &#8212; will kill people, by leading murderers to 
   their victims. It is nearly certain it will be used, as many existing 
   databases have already been, to harrass and to stalk individuals and 
   to commit crimes against them.</p>

<p>Because it is intended to be universal, because it will contain or 
   connect to so much information, and because it will feed other official 
   databases, the 
   <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/feb/27/idcards.immigrationpolicy">
   National Identity Register</a> has much more potential for harm than the 
   often patchy official records that already exist.</p> 

<p>The ID scheme is being designed to keep track, throughout your life, of 
   where you live and all your contacts with organisations that use the 
   Identity and Passport Service's 'verification service'. They are intended 
   to include health (e.g. registering with a GP) and social services 
   (e.g. applying for benefits), also banks and employers. Your track 
   may be followed by anyone interested in you who can gain access to 
   the system or a copy of your 'audit log'...</p>
