  <p align="center"><strong>What YOU can do to stop ID cards and the database state</strong></p><br />
  
  <p>The government thinks it is being clever. It will be registering people on the ID cards database 
            when they apply for a passport or other official documents. You may 
            have heard that the ID card is &#8220;voluntary&#8221;, but once your 
            details are entered onto the &#8216;National Identity Register&#8217; 
            database they are there for life.</p>
			
  <p>It is not just about a card. Once the details of your life are captured the government will 
            be sharing them with and between an ever growing list of agencies 
            and building an ever more detailed picture of your life. The HMRC 
            disaster with child benefit records has shown just how dangerous that 
            can be.</p>
			
  <p>Millions of people now know that having their identity &#8220;managed&#8221; by the government 
            is a bad idea. In just four weeks in 2005, more than 10,000 people 
            pledged online to refuse to register for an ID card. You may have 
            seen public figures declaring that they will go to prison rather than 
            be registered.</p>
			
  <p>The NO2ID Pledge is your opportunity to make a personal and public declaration that you will 
            refuse to comply with government control of your identity. Keeping 
            this promise means you avoid registration on the National Identity 
            Register. It is a serious commitment. Though at the moment there is 
            little to resist, the government is going to try and make life gradually 
            more inconvenient if you don&#8217;t comply &#8220;willingly&#8221;. 
            But with tens of thousands of others making the same declaration, 
            life could get pretty inconvenient for the government too.</p>
			
  <p>It is currently perfectly lawful to declare that you will not comply with the ID scheme. It 
            is possible that refusal could be made a crime, but the government 
            has shied away from that so far. If enough people say no, it will 
            be impossible. There would not be enough courts to prosecute 100,000 
            resisters, let alone millions. Together, now, we can build a wedge 
            of opposition that will jam the wheels of the ID scheme, and protect 
            the personal privacy of everyone in the country.</p>
			
  <p>The more people who commit themselves to resist, the more effective 
            it is. Say no to ID and it becomes more difficult to put pressure 
            on you and everyone else. Get your friends to pledge too, and everyone 
            protects one another. If you say no, then ID cards will fail.</p>
