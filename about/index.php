<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>NO2ID is the UK-wide, non-partisan campaign opposing the government's National Identity Scheme ('ID cards') and the database state.</p>
<p>We bring together individuals and organisations from all sections of the community and seek to ensure that the case against ID cards and the database state is forcefully put forward in the media, in the corridors of power and at grassroots level.</p>
<p>We continue to actively campaign on all fronts for the abolition of the ID scheme and repeal of the Identity Cards Act 2006.</p>

<h1>Who else says NO?</h1>
<p> Before the Identity Cards Act was even passed, over 12,000 people pledged to refuse to sign up to the government's ID Scheme and donate to towards a legal fund to fight the Act and protect those the government might prosecute for refusal to comply.</p>
