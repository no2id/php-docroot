<h2>I will Resist</h2> 
<p>The Government already know that millions of people oppose ID cards and have
deliberately planned the scheme so as to try minimising civil disobedience and the impact of 'refuseniks'.
The steep penalties and implicit threat of removing your right to travel are designed to scare people into
submission, but there are still ways in which you could <a href="#*">legally</a> resist or obstruct Home
Office plans for <em>total</em> identity control.

<p>Many people have already been thinking hard about what they could do when they are told they must register. 
Things which make registration impossible to complete or very expensive and time-consuming - all of these 
could be useful. You may have some ideas of your own given, say, the appalling unreliability of the 
biometrics used in the <acronymn title="United Kingdom Passport Service">UKPS</acronym> trial or some other 
aspect of the scheme. Non-cooperation can take many forms &#8212; what would you be willing to do?</p>

<p>The more different forms of refusal that people voice now, the harder it will be for the Government to 
say that their scheme will ever work. Prove them wrong... now! </p>

<p>We shall be publishing a selection of the best suggestions in due course, but here are a few we've had 
already:</p>

<blockquote>"Turn up at the 'Appointed time and place' very promptly and then demand that they take you
details immediately. When they refuse because people are waiting, tell them to give you another appointment
and walk out. You have complied with the law. Would be wise to have witness with you though."</blockquote>
<p><em>19275 Cloud B.</em></p>

<blockquote>"If you were to refuse, for example, to let your fingers make actual contact with a fingerprint
scanner and a Home Office employee were to physically push your hand down onto it, that could be classed as
common assault."</blockquote><p><em>Solicitor, West Midlands</em></p>

<blockquote>"How can anyone force me to uncross my eyes for an iris scan? There's no way they can prove 
it's deliberate and the test already fails for some people."</blockquote><p><em>Vicki</em></p>

<p><a name="*"></a>NO2ID as an organisation will work within the law to defeat the Identity Cards Bill. 
Were the Bill to become an Act, we would contest it an as unjust law.</p>
