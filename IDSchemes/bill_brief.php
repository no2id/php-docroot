<h1>Identity Cards Bill 2005: Briefing Notes</h1>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<h3>About No2ID</h3>
<p>No2ID is a diverse group of people and organisations, politically of all parties 
  and none, who stand against the government&#8217;s attempts to introduce intrusive, 
  expensive and ineffective control of personal identity.</p>
<p>We believe that government proposals to create a national identity scheme &#8212; 
  that includes an ID card &#8212; would fundamentally change the nature of the 
  relationship between citizen and state. We believe that government is the servant 
  of its citizens; citizens should not have to exist by permission of the government.</p>
<p>We are opposed to legislation that will require every citizen to report changes 
  of address to government on pain of imprisonment or any other imposed sanction 
  &#8212; including recurring and/or persistent fines. We believe that it is our 
  fundamental right to assert who we are, without being checked against an approved 
  list.</p>
<p>We believe that there is no case for a central identity database containing 
  everyone&#8217;s personal information that can be accessed by all branches of 
  government, and that any such database would represent a gross invasion of privacy.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>In these briefing notes, we have tried to avoid repeating comments made by 
  Liberty in their analysis of the Identity Cards Bill, except where we believe 
  emphasizing these points is particularly important. <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/privacy/id-card-bill-key-points.PDF">Liberty&#8217;s 
  analysis paper can be found from their website</a> and was written by Dr Caoilfhionn 
  Gallagher and Gareth Crossman.</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>The bill contains dozens of substantial new powers for the Home Secretary, 
  including powers to alter almost every detail of how the scheme operates, most 
  of which with only cursory Parliamentary oversight</p>
<p>The bill rewrites the Constitution, creating a flawed &#8220;superaffirmative&#8221; 
  process for approving secondary legislation, merely in order to avoid the political 
  problem of introducing compulsion through new primary legislation.</p>
<p>The moves to compulsion may be as arbitrary and discriminatory as the Home 
  Secretary sees fit, introducing onerous penalties to those who have been compelled.</p>
<p>The bill leaves most of the detail of the operation of the National Identity 
  Register and the ID cards scheme to secondary legislation &#8212; we contest 
  that Enabling Acts are dangerous.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary schedule for this bill is being rushed &#8212; and not only 
  by the Prime Minister&#8217;s desire to hold a General Election within the next 
  six months. Without fail, rushed legislation means flawed legislation.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the scheme has been accurately costed; this bill effectively 
  presents a blank cheque of taxpayers&#8217; money to the Home Office.</p>
<p>The bill provides minimal oversight for the scheme &#8212; less even than the 
  Draft Bill did.</p>
<p>The bill introduces an obviously-faulty presumption of accuracy for the data 
  in government databases.</p>
<p>Whether compelled or not, the bill makes maintenance of one&#8217;s record 
  on the National Identity Register both onerous and expensive &#8212; and all 
  polling data shows that the pop&not;ularity of the scheme drops away when the 
  costs are considered.</p>
<p>The bill codifies massive, broad data-sharing across government departments.</p>
<p>The bill introduces several new crimes, including some with no requirement 
  to prove <em>mens rea</em> and some that may not even be deliberate.</p>
<h2>More detailed analysis</h2>
<h3>New powers for the Home Secretary</h3>
<p>The Home Secretary is creating for himself 31 new powers, not including the 
  seven new fines he may levy or the eight new crimes created. Of these new powers, 
  nearly two-thirds have minimal oversight, even by the somewhat more lax standards 
  of secondary legislation.</p>
<p>Importantly, many of these new powers directly affect the few safeguards provided 
  over the scheme &#8212; which &#8220;registrable facts&#8221; may be listed 
  on the National Identity Register, for example.</p>
<p>Without affirmative Parliamentary oversight, the Home Secretary may cancel 
  or require surrender of an identity card, without a right of appeal, under clauses 
  13(1) and 13(2).</p>
<p>Without affirmative Parliamentary oversight, the Home Secretary may provide 
  information to numerous organs of state, without the consent of the individual, 
  under clauses 19(1) and 20(1). That same power extends to information being 
  provided to just about any &#8220;person&#8221; &#8212; including corporate 
  persons and foreign governments &#8212; under clause 22(1) with only the requirement 
  of an affirmative resolution of each House. It doesn&#8217;t seem overly paranoid 
  to imagine selected data being sold for marketing purposes (as happened with 
  the Electoral Roll), in the inevitable event of the scheme running over budget.</p>
<p>The Home Secretary can impose a requirement, under clause 5(4), for applicants 
  to attend at any specified place and time in order to have yet-to-be-determined 
  biometric data sampled and &#8220;otherwise to provide such information as may 
  be required by the Secretary of State&#8221;, with no requirement that the time 
  and place &#8212; or the other such information &#8212; be reasonable, for example.</p>
<p>Clause 3(5) allows the Secretary of State arbitrarily to amend &#8212; again, 
  with only secondary legislation &#8212; the details stored in the database, 
  including which (currently just the &#8220;audit trail&#8221;) gain the extra 
  protections in clause 19. Such changes should happen by amendment to primary 
  legislation, where proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate can occur.</p>
<h3>Introduction of compulsion</h3>
<p>More problematic, though, are the clause 6 powers to introduce compulsion. 
  Once compelled to acquire a card, individuals are treated far less leniently 
  in a whole raft of occasions.</p>
<p>Once an individual has been compelled to get a card, under threat of repeated 
  &pound;2500 fines for each occasion where the Home Secretary notified the individual 
  of their compulsion, &pound;1000 fines may be levied for forgetting to renew 
  their card (see clause 9), or for forgetting to jump through hoops set by the 
  Home Secretary in clause 5(4).</p>
<p>Similarly, once an individual has been compelled to get a card, the protections 
  against unlawfully requiring the presentation of an ID card no longer apply 
  &#8212; even for private services, as specified in clause 18(2)(c), let alone 
  the public services in clause 15(2).</p>
<p>Even ignoring the way in which individuals are treated after having been compelled 
  to acquire an ID card, the nature of clause 6 Orders is going to be discriminatory. 
  There is nothing on the face of the Bill to prevent clause 6 being used discriminatorily 
  &#8212; and doubtless exposing the government open to the danger of litigation 
  under the Human Rights Act and in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Many of the problems with the introduction of compulsion, however, are to do 
  with the Parliamentary process. The Home Office is evidently aware of the politically 
  controversial nature of compulsory ID cards and, in an attempt to avoid the 
  hassle of securing two pieces of primary legislation, has invented a wholly-new 
  means of approving legislation, spelled out in clause 7.</p>
<p>This &#8220;superaffirmative resolution&#8221; process, however, is badly flawed. 
  Not only does the process provide less oversight, exposure and opportunity for 
  debate than new primary legislation, but the superaffirmative process also fails 
  to provide any means for amending a resolution; it&#8217;s all or nothing.</p>
<p>Secondary legislation is never treated with the level of attention commensurate 
  with that of primary legislation; when Orders have been presented, in the past, 
  that have caused controversy about civil liberties, failure to secure an amendment 
  to negate a crucial point has rarely been followed by the whole Order falling. 
  As these clause 6 Orders cannot even be amended, it seems impossible to believe 
  that an Order will fall in order to prevent a controversial part of it.</p>
<h3>Enabling legislation and emergency legislation</h3>
<p>Since before the Enabling Act of March 1933, it has been well known that moving 
  too many powers to one place is a bad idea. By the same measure, some of the 
  worst legislation to make it through the Palace of Westminster has been hurried 
  through.</p>
<p>One only need look at the Defence of the Realm Acts, the Prevention of Terrorism 
  (Temporary Provisions) Acts, the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and the Video Recordings 
  Act 1984 &#8212; let alone the controversy surrounding provisions in the Anti-Terrorism, 
  Crime and Security Act 2001 or in the American equivalent, the &#8220;Patriot 
  Act&#8221; &#8212; to see that proper scrutiny makes better laws.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising, of course, that legislation passed with minimal debate 
  and little attention to the details tends to be viewed, in hindsight, as both 
  controversial and ineffective and tends to lead to miscarriages of justice.</p>
<p>It would make more sense for the Bill to wait until after the anticipated election 
  in May. This would allow Parliament to consider this Bill in greater depth and 
  to concentrate on more important &#8212; and less controversial &#8212; issues 
  that will benefit the population at large, for example promised charities legislation 
  and long-awaited Constitutional Reform.</p>
<h3>Presenting a blank cheque to the Home Office</h3>
<p>The proposed costings for the identity cards scheme are still the subject of 
  much debate. Whilst the Home Office has tried to maintain the original claims 
  made in the Entitlement Cards consultation &#8212; that the scheme would cost 
  between &pound;1.3 bn and &pound;3.1 bn &#8212; it seems clear that these estimates 
  are optimistic at best.</p>
<p>Independent analyses and all the evidence from schemes abroad have suggested 
  a price tag several times higher than this, if not an order of magnitude more. 
  Furthermore, the scheme is intended to be funded from the fees and fines levied 
  in its management. This seems to ignore all the evidence from opinion polls, 
  which show that support for an ID cards scheme in the UK drops away completely 
  once individuals realise the potential cost of the scheme; even the most recent 
  data, the ICM poll commissioned by Reform, with telephone polling on December 
  first and second, 2004, the overwhelming majority of individuals are unwilling 
  to pay more than even &pound;10 for an ID card, despite the initial figure showing 
  over 80% support for the principle of their introduction.</p>
<p>The cloak of commercial confidentiality maintained by the Home Office makes 
  public debate very difficult. The full cost of the scheme has not yet been detailed, 
  despite this having been much criticised during consultation. Until such a figure 
  has been made public &#8212; preferably before lucrative contracts have been 
  signed &#8212; the figures remain a mystery to all but those involved within 
  Queen Anne&#8217;s Gate</p>
<h3>Minimal oversight</h3>
<p>One of the details which most astounded observers, when the Identity Cards 
  Bill 2005 was published, was that the level of oversight &#8212; much criticised 
  in the Draft Bill &#8212; was weakened even further in the actual Bill introduced 
  to Parliament.</p>
<p>The Bill establishes, in clause 24, a National Identity Scheme Commissioner, 
  who will report not to Parliament but to the Home Secretary. Whilst the Home 
  Secretary must lay copies of the Commissioner&#8217;s annual reports before 
  Parliament, he has ensured that clause 25(4) provides him with broad powers 
  to edit these reports beforehand.</p>
<p>Compare the establishment and responsibilities of the National Identity Scheme 
  Commissioner, under the Identity Cards Bill 2005, to that of the Information 
  Commissioner, under the Data Protection Act 1998:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>6(1) The office originally established by section 3(1)(a) of the Data Protection 
	Act 1984 as the office of Data Protection Registrar shall continue to exist 
	for the purposes of this Act but shall be known as the office of Data Protection 
	Commissioner; and in this Act the Data Protection Commissioner is referred 
	to as &#8220;the Commissioner&#8221;.</p>
  <p>6(2) The Commissioner shall be appointed by Her Majesty by Letters Patent.</p>
  <p>51(1) It shall be the duty of the Commissioner to promote the following of 
	good practice by data controllers and, in particular, so to perform his functions 
	under this Act as to promote the observance of the requirements of this Act 
	by data controllers.</p>
  <p>51(3) Where&#8212;</p>
  <ul>
	<li>the Secretary of State so directs by order, or </li>
	<li>the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>the Commissioner shall, after such consultation with trade associations, 
	data subjects or persons representing data subjects as appears to him to be 
	appropriate, prepare and disseminate to such persons as he considers appropriate 
	codes of practice for guidance as to good practice.</p>
  <p>52(1) The Commissioner shall lay annually before each House of Parliament 
	a general report on the exercise of his functions under this Act.</p>
  <p>52(2) The Commissioner may from time to time lay before each House of Parliament 
	such other reports with respect to those functions as he thinks fit.</p>
  <p>52(3) The Commissioner shall lay before each House of Parliament any code 
	of prac&not;tice prepared under section 51(3) for complying with a direction 
	of the Secretary of State, unless the code is included in any report laid 
	under subsection (1) or (2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even without these powers of redaction, clause 24(3) restricts the matters 
  that the Commissioner may keep under review, not least to remove from his purview 
  just about every aspect that needs strong oversight &#8212; the use of Statutory 
  Instruments, the imposition of civil penalties, any criminal offences under 
  the Bill and the operation of the over&not;sight clauses themselves.</p>
<p>In addition to these restrictions, the oversight of any provision of information 
  to the intelli&not;gence services is automatically passed, by clause 26, to 
  the Intelligence Services Commissioner, established under the Regulation of 
  Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Whilst his reports are at least made to the Prime 
  Minister, rather than the Home Secretary, they are, yet again, redacted in advance 
  of being laid before Parliament, such that the oversight they might provide 
  can be minimal, at best.</p>
<p>We consider it quite inappropriate that the National Identity Scheme Commissioner&#8217;s 
  powers should be so tightly limited; even more inappropriate are the broad-ranging 
  powers of redaction awarded to the Home Secretary. Given that the only bodies 
  likely to be named as Designated Documents Authorities are public authorities, 
  any criticism of the scheme&#8217;s operation is arguably going to be &#8220;prejudicial 
  to the continued discharge of the functions of [a] public authority&#8221;; 
  those few comments that are not are likely to be &#8220;otherwise contrary to 
  the public interest&#8221; or &#8220;prejudicial to national security&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems to us that the Home Secretary has set up a situation where he doesn&#8217;t 
  even need to reach for Public Interest Immunity certificates in order to cover 
  up any contro&not;versy or scandal in agencies of his department.</p>
<h3>Presumption of accuracy</h3>
<p>As if the dangers of a large National Identity Register were not enough, clause 
  3(3) introduces a presumption of accuracy in that Register, meaning that any 
  consequences of inevitable errors in the database will be left with the individual, 
  who will have no opportunity for redress.</p>
<p>This problem is compounded by the power granted to the Home Secretary by clause 
  21, which allows the Secretary of State to &#8216;correct&#8217; information 
  &#8220;where it appears to [him] that the information was inaccurate or incomplete&#8221;. 
  On the surface of it, this might seem a sensible provision, except that there 
  is no requirement that the Home Secretary verify that what appears to him is 
  actually the case; it is inevitable, in a database of 75 million individuals, 
  that this power will introduce greater inaccuracy to the dataset.</p>
<p>It is, of course, nonsense, to presume that data already held by organs of 
  state are accurate. We already know, for example, that well over a third more 
  National Insurance numbers exist than there are people entitled to them. Many 
  people are already quite accustomed to having their names spelt differently 
  by different parts of the Civil Service. Allowing the incorporation of these 
  data is a recipe for confusion.</p>
<h3>Maintenance of an individual&#8217;s record</h3>
<p>Maintaining one&#8217;s record on the National Identity Register is made both 
  onerous and expensive. Any change in personal circumstances, such as moving 
  house, requires notification to the Home Secretary and a concomitant fee to 
  be paid. To make matters even worse, should a card be issued with an error, 
  such as a misspelling of the name, the individual has to pay such a fee for 
  mistakes made by civil servants!</p>
<p>Similarly, if the Home Secretary cancels an individual&#8217;s ID card, for 
  any of the range of reasons laid out in clause 13(2), or requires the holder 
  to surrender it, under clause 13(4), then the acquisition of a new card will 
  cost the payment of another fee.</p>
<p>It is important that the data about an individual be owned by that individual 
  and not by the State. Equally, individuals should maintain control over their 
  own records, including the ability to view, all aspects of their own records 
  &#8212; including the audit trail &#8212; without addi&not;tional charge.</p>
<p>To ensure the accuracy of records, subject access disclosure (similar to under 
  the Data Protection Acts) ought to be encouraged and occur regularly, without 
  additional charge. The Bill makes such no provisions to ensure that individuals 
  have an opportunity to check their records are reliable, accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Whilst even &#8216;average&#8217; individuals are likely to find maintaining 
  their record to be somewhat onerous, these problems are compounded for anyone 
  whose circumstances are a little out of the ordinary. Even just informing the 
  Secretary of State of changes of address &#8212; and having to pay for the privilege 
  &#8212; is likely to cause serious problems for the homeless, or any of the 
  40% of London&#8217;s population who move every year. How can someone fleeing 
  domestic abuse be expected to notify the state every time they move, let alone 
  trust that the information won&#8217;t make its way to the abuser?</p>
<h3>Data-sharing provisions</h3>
<p>We are particularly concerned with the breadth of the data-sharing provisions. 
  Clause 19 lists a large number of bodies who may be provided with information 
  without the subj&not;ect&#8217;s consent, even before one considers that clauses 
  20 to 23 allow even wider information-sharing.</p>
<p>Data may, in the first instance, be shared with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Security Service (MI5);</em></li>
  <li><em>Secret Intelligence Service (MI6);</em></li>
  <li><em>Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ);</em></li>
  <li><em>Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA);</em></li>
  <li><em>National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS; until the establishment 
	of SOCA);</em></li>
  <li><em>National Crime Squad (until the establishment of SOCA);</em></li>
  <li>Any police force (including extraordinary constabularies such as the MoD 
	Police and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary);</li>
  <li>Inland Revenue;</li>
  <li>HM Customs and Excise;</li>
  <li>Any government department (in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland);</li>
  <li>Any Designated Documents Authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>More disturbingly, however, clause 19(2) grants the intelligence services (italicised 
  in the list above) access to the &#8220;audit trail&#8221; &#8212; and clause 
  20(4) extends that access to anyone in the list for &#8220;purposes connected 
  with the prevention or detection of serious crime&#8221;, as defined in clause 
  81(2) and (3) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.</p>
<p>This &#8220;audit trail&#8221; provides a massive amount of information about 
  an individual. If it is the government&#8217;s intention that ID cards should 
  become so popular that they are used in many everyday transactions, then this 
  audit trail will allow someone to reconstruct a lot of information about an 
  individual, with very little oversight.</p>
<p>Britain is already the most highly surveiled nation on the planet; providing 
  access to this audit trail will allow organs of state not only to know when 
  someone has interacted with the police, but also when they visited their GP, 
  or went to the local genito-urinary clinic &#8212; possibly even when they went 
  to the supermarket, if an ID card was used to guarantee the credit card transaction.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that all the powers in the Bill refer to providing 
  information without any requirement that such information be provided piecemeal. 
  Nothing on the face of the Bill would seem to prevent direct access to parts 
  of the National Identity Register. There seems to be little protection from 
  law enforcement and intelligence agencies performing &#8220;fishing expeditions&#8221;. 
  Combining this with the clause 22(1) powers means that such direct access might 
  not even be restricted to domestic agencies but, in time, could stretch to European 
  agencies or providing a new level to the Special Relationship, for example. 
</p>
<h3>New crimes</h3>
<p>Several new crimes are introduced by the Bill, many of which do not require 
  the establishment of <em>mens rea</em>. Several of these are particularly concerning; 
  especially those established by clauses 27(5) and 29(1).</p>
<p>Clause 27(5) appears to be a version of the offences under 27(1) and 27(3) 
  &#8212; possession of a false identity document, of an identity document under 
  false auspices or of equipment to create forgeries &#8212; designed to make 
  it easier to convict without proving <em>mens rea</em>.</p>
<p>The intention of clause 29(1) appears to be to prevent civil servants abusing 
  their positions and selling or otherwise leaking information form the National 
  Identity Register. We find it most disconcerting, however, that it would seem 
  also to prevent whistleblowing by anyone working on any part of the ID cards 
  scheme that discovers any kind of malfeasance.</p>
