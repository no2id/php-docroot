<h1>Problems the ID Card scheme is meant to solve </h1>
<h2 id="terrorism">How will ID cards protect  us from the threat of terrorism?</h2>
<p>They won't.</p>
<p>Despite evidence that the  biggest threat of terrorism is home-grown, arguments that ID cards will  &lsquo;protect&rsquo; us from foreign-born terrorists continue to grow.&nbsp; This is simply not the case.&nbsp; Foreigners who are in the UK for three months or less will  not have to carry one.&nbsp; Three months is  plenty of time to arrive, plant a bomb and leave again.&nbsp; To those who are resident and will have to  carry them, an ID card will deter them no less than, say, a bus pass. </p>
<p>The July 7 bombers actually carried credit cards with them to identify them after the bombings, because <em>they wanted to be recognized as martyrs</em>.&nbsp; They would have been equally capable of carrying out the attacks with ID cards in their pockets.  </p>
<h2 id="illegalWorking">What will this do to combat illegal working?</h2>
<p>It will almost certainly encourage it.&nbsp; Other countries such as Spain, which do have identity cards, have similar levels of illegal working.</p>
<p>At present, under the current barrage of Immigration Acts, an employer who employs illegal immigrants faces heavy penalties.&nbsp; To demonstrate that they acted in good faith, they must show that upon employing the person, they have shown a recent (last three months) document  from the Home Office confirming the employee&rsquo;s entitlement to work.</p>
If a person enters the UK for  more than three months, and is entitled to work, they will be given an identity  card.&nbsp; The employer will now only have to check the identity card in  order to employ this person.&nbsp; If they  overstay their visa (for example, a person on a one year&rsquo;s working  holiday-maker&rsquo;s visa, who stays for six years) but are in possession of an  identity card, it will be very easy for them to remain - illegally - in  employment.
<h2 id="identityFraud">How will ID cards and the  NIR help tackle identity fraud?</h2>
<p>In theory, it will be impossible to have more than one identity, because it will be impossible to obtain an ID card in more than one name &ndash; your biometrics will already be on the database, thus alerting the official to the fact that you have an ID card already.</p>
<p>This of course presupposes that the sort of people who want multiple identities are otherwise law-abiding types, who will bother to go down to the local registration centre to register more than once.&nbsp; It ignores the fact that criminal gangs will almost certainly be able to forge multiple ID cards.&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality, therefore, identity fraud will remain a problem but the organized gangs will make enormous profits.</p>
This will lead to a  situation where benefit fraud, opening multiple bank accounts, obtaining  multiple loans etc. is made easier &ndash;  because the biometrics are unlikely to be checked on every single one of these  minor transactions.&nbsp; The card will be  looked over by an official and if all seems well, the transaction will be processed.&nbsp; Spot checks are more likely to occur as it  will be impossible to check the biometrics on every occasion.
<h2 id="benefitFraud">How will ID cards and the NIR help tackle benefit fraud?</h2>
<p>They won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;  However sophisticated the technology is, it is unlikely that an  organised criminal gang will be unable to reproduce the cards.&nbsp; This means that benefit fraud will become  easier in many respects &ndash; if a person claims twice in their own name, as  happens now, they are often caught.&nbsp; If  they claim in multiple (forged) identities, it will be much harder to prevent. </p>
