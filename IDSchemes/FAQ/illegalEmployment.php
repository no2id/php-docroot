<h1>Illegal Employment </h1>
<h2 id="combatIllegalWorking">What will this do to combat illegal working?</h2>
<p>It will almost certainly encourage it.&nbsp; Other countries such as Spain, which do have identity cards, have similar levels of illegal working.</p>
<p>At present, under the current barrage of Immigration Acts, an employer who employs illegal immigrants faces heavy penalties.&nbsp; To demonstrate that they acted in good faith, they must show that upon employing the person, they have shown a recent (last three months) document  from the Home Office confirming the employee&rsquo;s entitlement to work.</p>
<p>If a person enters the UK for  more than three months, and is entitled to work, they will be given an identity  card.&nbsp; The employer will now only have to check the identity card in  order to employ this person.&nbsp; If they  overstay their visa (for example, a person on a one year&rsquo;s working  holiday-maker&rsquo;s visa, who stays for six years) but are in possession of an  identity card, it will be very easy for them to remain - illegally - in  employment.
