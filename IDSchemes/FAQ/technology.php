<h2>Biometrics </h2>
<h3 id="whatIs">What is biometrics?</h3>
<p>The Home Office says that:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/comrace/identitycards/faq.html#7">
  <p>&quot;A  biometric is a unique identifying physical characteristic. Examples include  facial recognition, iris patterns and fingerprints.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biometrics is not that simple.&nbsp; Biometrics is the science of measuring and statistically analyzing human body characteristics, such as faces, iris patterns, fingerprints, voice recognition and so on.&nbsp; These characteristics are not always unique, and so biometrics is used to give a statistical probability of identification rather than a definite identification.</p>
<h3 id="benefits">What is the benefit of having biometrics?</h3>
The benefit is an added &quot;safeguard&quot; to prevent another person from using  your identity card.&nbsp; A fingerprint is  much more difficult to forge than a signature.&nbsp;  This of course relies on your biometric data being checked against the  national database every time the card is used.
<h3 id="whatBiometrics">What biometrics will be used?</h3>
<p>This is not yet certain.&nbsp; The Home Office say that the Bill allows for the recording of <em>any </em>biometric.&nbsp; It is likely that facial image, fingerprints and iris patterns will be used.&nbsp; Other biometrics which could be used are retina scans, voice patterns, hand measurements and even the whorls on your ear.</p>
<h3 id="reliability">How reliable are they?</h3>
<p>Not reliable enough!&nbsp; Tests were done on a sample of 10,000 volunteers, including disabled volunteers.&nbsp; These showed that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facial scans worked for 69% of the &quot;quota&quot; group and 48%  of disabled volunteers. That is three in ten of the &lsquo;quota group&rsquo; and more than  half of the disabled who were unable to use the facial scan technology.</li>
  <li>Fingerprints  worked for 81% of &quot;quota&quot; group and 80% of disabled people, but was  more successful for young people. That is, two in ten people in both groups.</li>
  <li>Iris  scans worked for 96% of &quot;quota&quot; volunteers and 91% of the disabled  group. Some glasses wearers failed the checks unless they took their glasses  off.</li>
  <li>0.62% of the disabled group could not enrol using any of the  systems.&nbsp; That is nearly one in a  hundred.&nbsp; There are fifty million people  in the UK  &ndash; five hundred thousand will be un-registrable.</li>
  <li>Black participants and  participants aged over 59 had lower iris enrolment success rates according to  the study. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Information Technology</h2>
<h3 id="ITFailure">Won&rsquo;t this project suffer the same problems of all major IT projects in Government?</h3>
<p>The Government has not successfully completed any of the ambitious computer projects it has embarked on while in power. This does not bode well for the NIR, which is <em>bigger and more complex than any yet attempted</em>. A large number of IT experts have expressed doubts about the potential for success of this database.</p>
