<h1>Access to public  services</h1>
<h2 id="whichServices">What public services will I need an ID Card for?</h2>
<p>The Identity Cards Bill does not currently specify what services will require an ID Card to gain access to them. This will be decided in later, less scrutinized, secondary legislation. The Government has indicated that from an as yet unspecified date all those registering for a passport for the first time, or renewing their passport will be automatically entered on to the NIR.</p>
<p>There is also a risk of <em><a href="#functionCreep">function creep</a></em> in which, because they are not specified, the number of services that come to require ID Cards gradually increases. </p>
<p>This is most likely to begin with those claiming benefits and possibly increase to include even those wanting non-emergency NHS treatment.
  <!-- don't change anything after this -->

<h2 id="lostCard">If my card is lost or stolen will I be able to access services?</h2>
<p>Such details as this have not yet been finalised.</p>
<p>There would almost certainly be some delay whilst the new card was organised and the individual's identity re-confirmed. It is likely this will be at cost to the individual, as this is the trend set by other aspects of the legislation, such as correcting mistakes or registering changes in details.</p>
<h2 id="functionCreep">What is function creep?</h2>
<p>Function  creep with relation to this scheme is the term given to the phenomenon of the gradual increase of the number  of occasions that will demand an Identity Card.</p>
<p>In  other words, the current legislation does not make the card compulsory for  anything. However, the Government has indicated it intends to bring this  situation about ultimately, potentially by requiring a Card to access benefits  and NHS treatment. The legislation currently presents a relatively powerless  Card, however, scope has been secured to allow the Card and the Register to  become increasingly more powerful.</p>
