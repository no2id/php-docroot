<h1>The Identity Cards Bill </h1>
<h2 id="introduce">What does the identity cards bill introduce?</h2>
<p>The Bill outlines a nationalised identity system with  multiple layers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The National  Identification Register (NIR)</dt>
<dd>Everyone will be numbered, and checked. Your National  Identity Registration Number (NIRN) will become the &ldquo;key&rdquo; for all you contact  with government and any private sector organisations that may be allowed to  check the NIR.</dd>
<dt>Collecting personal  details</dt>
<dd>Certain details (such as name and address) become  &ldquo;registrable facts&rdquo; which you are compelled to disclose&mdash;and, once you are  registered, to notify any changes to the authorities.</dd>
<dt>Collection and  checking of &ldquo;biometrics&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>You will be fingerprinted and probably have your eyes scanned.</dd>
<dt><a href="/IDSchemes/FAQ/cards.php">The card itself</a></dt>
<dd>The card will carry details about you on a computer chip, as  well as a picture.</dd>
<dt>A national scanner  network and new &quot;secure infrastructure&quot;</dt>
<dd>To read the chip on the card and check your fingerprints,  etc, against the central database, needs special machines to be installed  anywhere your ID might be checked.</dd>
<dt>Widespread use by  organisations</dt>
<dd>Use of the system across the private and public sectors will  make life increasingly difficult without it. This is sometimes called  &ldquo;administrative convergence&rdquo;. Organisations will be strongly encouraged to use  the unique NIRN to identify your file in any records they keep, ultimately  making it the most convenient method.</dd>
<dt>Data-sharing  between organisations on an unprecedented scale</dt>
<dd>The register will contain all the official numbers used to  identify you in different systems: tax, national insurance, NHS. Agencies will  be required to notify each other of changes to a person's details. The Home  Office may disclose details about you from the register to other agencies  without your consent.</dd>
<dt>Enforcement via a  new system of crimes and penalties</dt>
<dd>There would be large penalties to force people to comply  with the system.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="why">Why introduce Identity Cards and the National Identity Register? </h2>
<p>The Government has suggested that the new measures  introduced by the Identity Cards Bill will tackle a number of issues, such as  <a href="/IDSchemes/FAQ/terrorism.php">terrorism</a>, <a href="/IDSchemes/FAQ/identityFraud.php">identity theft</a>, illegal immigration and <a href="/IDSchemes/FAQ/benefitFraud.php">benefit fraud</a>. NO2ID  contends that the legislation proposed will do little to combat any of these  problems, while restricting the freedoms and contravening the civil rights of  law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>More recently, Tony McNulty, the Home Office minister now  responsible for Identity Cards said</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;Perhaps in the past the government, in  its enthusiasm, oversold the advantages of identity cards. We did suggest, or  at least implied, that they might well be a panacea for identity fraud, for  benefit fraud, terrorism, entitlement and access to public services. In its  enthusiasm, the government had over-emphasised the benefits to the  state rather than for the individual in providing a gold standard in proving  your identity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="startingDate">When will these things be introduced?
  <!-- don't change anything after this -->
</h2>
<p>There is no set date as the legislation has not yet been passed. </p>
<p>It is likely that, after a certain date not yet fixed by the Government, all those registering or renewing their passport will automatically be registered on the National Identity Register</p>
<h2 id="easierLife">Will these things make my life easier? </h2>
<p>In theory having a single form of identification for everyone will make presenting an identification document more straightforward. However, getting hold of one of these documents will require a journey to provide the information to an official centre, allocated arbitrarily. In addition, individuals will have to return on a regular basis to renew their card. All changes in the information held on the NIR must be registered at one of the centres, for example when moving house, at a cost to the Card holder. </p>
<p>The increased likelihood of identity theft (calculated from the numerous experiences of other countries, such as America and Australia) will also mean that more people will suffer the inconvenience and distress that this causes.</p>
<p>All of this, while the cards themselves are unlikely to address or resolve the problems they are being introduced to combat.</p>
