<h1>ID Cards and the National Identity Register: The Bill a Summary</h1>
<p> Many people believe that the government&#8217;s ID scheme is just a &#8220;simple 
  piece of plastic&#8221;. This could not be further from the truth. The government 
  is planning to establish a vast, complex and far-reaching system that will involve 
  an unprecedented use of personal information.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>The Bill outlines an identity system that has eight components 
	</strong> 
	<ol>
	  <li> The National Identification Register. Clause 1 of the Bill imposes 
		an obligation on the Secretary of State to establish a central population 
		register containing a wide range of details of every UK citizen and resident 
		aged 16 and above.</li>
	  <li> The code. Clause 2 (6) requires that every individual must be given 
		a unique number.</li>
	  <li> Biometrics. Clause 5 (5) requires individuals to submit to fingerprinting 
		and &#8220;other&#8221; means of physical identification. This is likely 
		to include electronic face scanning and iris recognition. </li>
	  <li> The card. Clause 8 establishes the actual identity card, generated 
		from and containing the information in the Register.</li>
	  <li> Legal obligations. Clause 15 establishes a requirement to produce the 
		card in order to obtain public services.</li>
	  <li> Administrative convergence. The number and the card register are used 
		by a variety of agencies and organisations as their administrative basis. 
		1 (5) permits the bringing together of all registration numbers (National 
		Insurance, NHS etc) used by a person. </li>
	  <li> Cross notification. Agencies will be required to notify each other 
		of changes to a person's details. Clause 19 authorises the Secretary of 
		State to disclose details from the register to other agencies without 
		the consent of the individual.</li>
	  <li> New crimes and penalties. The Bill establishes a large number of new 
		crimes and offences to ensure that people comply with the ID requirements.</li>
	</ol>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Will an identity card help eliminate benefit fraud?</strong><br>
	The government has not provided evidence to support such a claim. David Blunkett 
	went so far as to dismiss the significance of identity fraud in welfare, saying 
	&quot;benefit fraud is only a tiny part of the problem in the benefit system&quot;. 
	The majority of fraud on the benefits system is through under-reporting of 
	income, or non-reporting of financial and family circumstances. Benefits agencies 
	worldwide agree that false identity is not a key issue. The cost to government 
	of establishing an ID infrastructure for benefits would amount to many times 
	the annual loss through false identity.</li>
  <li> <strong>Will an identity card help prevent terrorism?</strong><br>
	The government has no idea. On July 3rd, in response to a question by Chris 
	Mullin MP, David Blunkett said, &#8220;I accept that it is important that 
	we do not pretend that an entitlement card would be an overwhelming factor 
	in combating international terrorism&#8221;. The published evidence refutes 
	all these claims. In 2004 Privacy International published the findings of 
	the only research ever conducted on the relationship between identity cards 
	and terrorism. It found that there was no evidence to support the claim that 
	identity cards can combat terrorist threats. The report stated: &#8220;The 
	presence of an identity card is not recognised by analysts as a meaningful 
	or significant component in anti-terrorism strategies. Almost two thirds of 
	known terrorists operate under their true identity. The remainder use a variety 
	of techniques to forge or impersonate identities. It is possible that the 
	existence of a high integrity identity card would provide a measure of improved 
	legitimacy for these people.&#8221;</li>
  <li><strong> Will the Identity system reduce the problem of Identity theft?</strong><br>
	There is a substantial body of evidence to show that the establishment of 
	centralised identity can increase the incidence of identity theft. The clearest 
	example of this relationship exists in the United States, where the Social 
	Security Number has become an identity hub and a central reference point to 
	index and link identity. Obtaining a person&#8217;s SSN provides a single 
	interface with that person&#8217;s dealings with a vast number of private 
	and public bodies. Hence the level of identity theft in the US is extremely 
	high. This situation applies equally in Australia, where the introduction 
	of a Tax File Number has also increased the incidence of identity theft beyond 
	the levels experienced in the UK. The key factor behind identity theft is 
	the widespread availability of a central number, linked to a range of personal 
	information.</li>
  <li> <strong>Will the Identity system reduce illegal immigration and illegal 
	working?</strong><br>
	Even if all legal UK residents were to have ID cards, non-residents would 
	still be able to enter the country under a 3-month tourist visa or forged 
	identity documents of other countries. An ID scheme will create social unrest 
	as &#8216;foreign-looking&#8217; people are targeted for ID checks. Illegal 
	workers are employed by people who do not care about checking their NI number 
	or other details. They are not going to start caring if there is an ID Card 
	scheme.</li>
  <li><strong> How much will the scheme cost the taxpayer?</strong><br>
	The government estimated in 2002 that the scheme would cost somewhere in the 
	order of &pound;3.1 billion. When in 2004 the Home Affairs Committee asked 
	the Home Secretary to clarify the exact amount he refused, citing commercial 
	secrecy. By the time the final Bill was published in November 2004 the government 
	acknowledged that the cost of the scheme over ten years would be &pound;5.5 
	billion. The financial impact on public services and employers, e.g. for secure 
	scanning equipment and the people to run it, has yet to be calculated. </li>
  <li><strong>Who will pay for this scheme?</strong><br>
	We will pay for it out of our own pockets. An &#8220;enhanced&#8221; passport 
	(the international requirement for enhancement is just one biometric, a digital 
	photo of your face, but the Government wants to incorporate at least three 
	&#8211; including your fingerprints and iris scan), which includes an entry 
	on the national register with no opt-out, will cost around &pound;85. An ID 
	card without a passport will cost between &pound;35 and &pound;40. There will 
	be a charge for the renewal or replacement of cards. </li>
  <li> <strong>Is the card compulsory or voluntary?</strong><br>
	The intention has always been to create a compulsory regime. Government ministers 
	have almost unanimously ruled out the option for legal compulsion to carry 
	a card, and indeed clause 15 (3) of the Bill specifically rules out any provision 
	for requiring people to carry the card at all times. This clause also rules 
	out compulsion to submit a card to receive a benefit or any public service. 
	<br>
	However, this clause does not provide protection to anyone who has been ordered 
	to register for a card under clause 6 of the Bill. 6 (1) makes clear that 
	the Secretary of State can order anybody or everybody to register for a card. 
	This might include benefits recipients, new employees, people wanting to open 
	a bank account, people of a particular ethnicity, people who have been in 
	contact with law enforcement or, indeed, the entire population. Clause 2 (4) 
	of the Bill allows the Secretary of State to enter a person onto the National 
	Identity Register without that person&#8217;s consent. This power will apply, 
	for example, when a person applies for or renews a passport. Passport holders 
	will automatically be entered onto the identification register. For those 
	people who do not have a passport, 6 (1) allows the government to require 
	you to be registered.</li>
  <li><strong> Presumption of accuracy</strong><br>
	As if the dangers of a large National Identity Register were not enough, clause 
	3(3) intro&not;duces a presumption of accuracy in that Register, meaning that 
	any consequences of inevitable errors in the database will be left with the 
	individual, who will have no opportu&not;nity for redress.<br>
	This problem is compounded by the power granted to the Home Secretary by clause 
	21, which allows the Secretary of State to &#8216;correct&#8217; information 
	&#8220;where it appears to [him] that the information was inaccurate or incomplete&#8221;. 
	On the surface of it, this might seem a sensible provision, except that there 
	is no requirement that the Home Secretary verify that what appears to him 
	is actually the case; it is inevitable, in a database of 75 million individuals, 
	that this power will introduce greater inaccuracy to the dataset.</li>
  <li> <strong>Maintenance of an individual&#8217;s record and data sharing</strong><br>
	Maintaining one&#8217;s record on the National Identity Register is made both 
	onerous and expensive. Any change in personal circumstances, such as moving 
	house, requires noti&not;fi&not;cation to the Home Secretary and a concomitant 
	fee to be paid. To make matters even worse, should a card be issued with an 
	error, such as a misspelling of the name, the individual has to pay such a 
	fee for mistakes made by civil servants!<br>
	Clause 19 lists a large number of bodies that may be provided with information 
	without the subj&not;ect&#8217;s consent, even before one considers that clauses 
	20 to 23 allow even wider information sharing. Data may, in the first instance, 
	be shared with:
	<ul>
	  <li> Security Service (MI5);</li>
	  <li>Secret Intelligence Service (MI6);</li>
	  <li>Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ);</li>
	  <li>Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA);</li>
	  <li>National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS, until the establishment 
		of SOCA);</li>
	  <li>National Crime Squad (until the establishment of SOCA);</li>
	  <li>Any police force (including special constabularies such as the MoD Police 
		and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary);</li>
	  <li> Inland Revenue;</li>
	  <li>HM Customs and Excise;</li>
	  <li>Any government department (in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland);</li>
	  <li>Any Designated Documents Authority.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ol>
