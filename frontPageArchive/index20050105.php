<h1>Labour&#8217;s hasty and reckless ID Cards Bill spells disaster for third 
  term</h1>

<p>The true purpose of the rushed and controversial ID Cards Bill was revealed 
  last week as the Tories were forced to concede the far-right ground on law and 
  order and immigration to Labour. But the Government&#8217;s determination to 
  squander billions and fundamentally shift the relationship between the citizen 
  and the state for short term political - gain risks political disaster in a 
  potential third term.</p>
<p>NO2ID National Coordinator, Phil Booth, said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Labour&#8217;s ID Cards Bill is not about spending resources wisely to safeguard 
	the security of this country. It is all about the Labour party looking tough 
	before election and outmanoeuvring the Tories &#8211; which they have successfully 
	done this week. By taking this reckless course they risk a massive resistance 
	from the 3 million or more people who have declared they would rather go to 
	prison than submit to having ID Cards. The backlash could far exceed the impact 
	of Stop the War and the Countryside Alliance and could turn into Labour&#8217;s 
	Poll tax.</p>

	terrorists</a></li>

  <li><a href="/IDSchemes/faq.php#9">An ID scheme will cost 
	billions in taxpayers money</a></li>
  <li><a href="/IDSchemes/faq.php#5">An ID scheme will mean 
	your most intimate details will be controlled by the government forever</a></li>
