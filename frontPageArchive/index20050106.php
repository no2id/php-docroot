<h1>New Year's Revelations</h1>
<p>Files just released to the National Archives under the '30-year rule' reveal that Harold Wilson's Labour government dismissed ID cards in 1974, even after IRA bombs in Guildford and Birmingham had killed 25 people and injured hundreds. Home Secretary Roy Jenkins condemned ID cards as "expensive and ineffective" and also feared that they would seriously infringe civil liberties. BBC NEWS has more details and a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4139049.stm#">video report</a></p>
<p>We all know that times and attitudes change but a statement by another well known Labour politician, speaking at their Party conference in October 1995 regarding Michael Howard's plans to introduce ID cards, only serves to emphasise by how much:</p>
<blockquote>
"And instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards as the Tory Right demand, let that money provide thousands of extra police officers on the beat in our local communities."
</blockquote>
<p>This certainly sounds sensible, who could possibly have said it?</p>
<p>Tony Blair. (<a href="http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/rapport/fulltext/r202195.htm">Full transcript</a> of his speech to the Labour Congress on 3rd October 1995)</p>

<h1>Labour&#8217;s hasty and reckless ID Cards Bill spells disaster for third 
  term</h1>

<p>The true purpose of the rushed and controversial ID Cards Bill was revealed 
  last week as the Tories were forced to concede the far-right ground on law and 
  order and immigration to Labour. But the Government&#8217;s determination to 
  squander billions and fundamentally shift the relationship between the citizen 
  and the state for short term political - gain risks political disaster in a 
  potential third term.</p>
<p>NO2ID National Coordinator, Phil Booth, said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Labour&#8217;s ID Cards Bill is not about spending resources wisely to safeguard 
	the security of this country. It is all about the Labour party looking tough 
	before election and outmanoeuvring the Tories &#8211; which they have successfully 
	done this week. By taking this reckless course they risk a massive resistance 
	from the 3 million or more people who have declared they would rather go to 
	prison than submit to having ID Cards. The backlash could far exceed the impact 
	of Stop the War and the Countryside Alliance and could turn into Labour&#8217;s 
	Poll tax.</p>
