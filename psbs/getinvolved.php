Everywhere, if enough people care, then politicians <em>have</em> to listen. So help the NO2ID campaign wake a Britain that is "sleepwalking into a surveillance society".</p>

  	<p>If people look behind ID cards at the whole National Identity Scheme, and say they don't want flat plastic lives fit for an official file - we win.</p>

	<p>If ID is discussed at every breakfast table, in every pub, and every club – we win.</p>
	
	<p>Before the government introduced its ID legislation, around 80% of people thought ID cards might be a good idea. Once they find out what 'ID cards' really mean, over 50% think they are a bad idea. The Home Office has no arguments. Its answer to questions is not to say more, but to repeat the empty claims it made before.</p>

	<p>Tell your friends. Tell your enemies, too. This is something that matters to everyone. If someone isn't worried, they haven't understood.</p>

	<p>To get a booklet explaining how to make our case, send a stamped addressed C5 envelope marked "How to win" to <strong>NO2ID, Box 412, 19-21 Crawford Street, London W1H 1PJ</strong></p>

	<p>You can get a supporter's information pack and regular news from NO2ID by filling in <a href="/index.php"><strong>the form on our home page</strong></a>.</p>

	<p>And to get in touch with others near you, or even to get something started in your area, visit <a href="/localgroups/"><strong>NO2ID's local groups section</strong></a>. All over the UK, people <em>are</em> waking up.</p>
