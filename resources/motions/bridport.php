<h1>Bridport Town Council</h1>
<h2>February 5th 2008</h2>

<p>The following motion is being presented at the meeting of Bridport
Town Council on February 5th 2008.<br /><br />

6. NOTICE OF MOTION<br />
To consider the following motion received from Cllr C.M. Ray on 28 January 2008:<br /><br />

The Bridport Town Council resolves to:<br /><br />

1. make it a policy of the Council that national identity cards would
not be required to access Town Council services, unless specifically
required to do so by Act of Parliament.<br /><br />

2. take no part in any pilot scheme or feasibility work in relation to
the introduction of the national identity cards.<br /><br />

3. only co-operate with the national identity card scheme where to do
otherwise would be unlawful.
<br /><br />
4. support the NO2ID campaign whose supporters already include MPs and
Peers of all parties, City, County and District Councils, unions
(including UNISON, the largest union in the UK with 1.3 million
members) and several political parties.<br /><br />

The motion is proposed because the Council accepts that:<br /><br />

1) the disadvantages, both financial and personal, of such a scheme
will outweigh any likely benefits to the people of Bridport and the
surrounding area.<br /><br />

2) the scheme will do little, if anything, to prevent terrorism, crime or fraud.<br /><br />

3) the national database that underpins the identity card scheme may
facilitate criminal fraud, terrorism and potential state abuses of
human rights.<br /><br />

4) the ID card and database proposals are likely to fundamentally
alter the relationship between the state and the individual.<br /><br />

and the Council urges the Government to reconsider legislation to
impose Identification cards.</p>
