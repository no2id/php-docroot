It would be appreciated if the following advice were used:
[adapted from http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page46.asp]

* Amendments should be listed in the order in which they occur in the
  Constitution;
* Please use one of these five commands: *"delete"*, *"insert"*, *"substitute"*,
  *"re-number"* and *"re-letter"*;
* Padding such as *"delete the word"* and *"in its entirety"* should not be used;
* Re-numberings should be implemented as they arise. So, for example, a typical
  sequence might be:
    1. Delete clause 7
    2. Re-number clause 8-17 as clauses 7-16.
    3. In clause 10 as re-numbered, delete.....
* Formulations such as *"wherever it occurs"* ~can~ be used to indicate
  repeated changes, though amendments using this approach should list the
  affected instances.
* Care should be taken to ensure that amendments are unambiguous, particularly
  where words occur more than once in the text being amended;
* Please send amendments as plain text and NOT as attachments or messy HTML.
